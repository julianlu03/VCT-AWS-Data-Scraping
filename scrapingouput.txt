A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Byrne is fiercely loyal to all his allies and organizations, always keeps his squadmates close. But although he would do anything for them, Byrne hasn't always been able to save everyone. After the death of a close friend, Tariq Porter, his loss greatly affected Byrne, haunted by what had happened despite all his own best efforts to save him. It was around this time that he would then join , giving him something at a time when he needed it most. Byrne would go on to become a veteran of Kingdom's K-SEC branch, once again developing a strong loyalty to his employer. Shortly after the events of the VALORANT Protocol was then founded, with Byrne leaving K-SEC to join forces with fellow Kingdom colleagues , , and the phantom known as , taking on an undercover life by the call sign "Brimstone". Under Brimstone's leadership, the organization grew ever larger, recruiting more agents from across the globe as they worked to stop agents from the alternate-dimension from stealing from Alpha. While operations were mostly successful and initially kept heavily compartmentalized even between agents, the failure of one particular mission in and the catastrophe that occurred as a result caused VALORANT to reconsider its approach, moving forward with agents all getting to know one another and being assigned on strike teams together. All this time, Brimstone's position has left him with more of a back-line presence, but life behind a desk has never been of interest to him, and he will still make sure to be present in the field from time to time. Though no longer part of Kingdom while at VALORANT, Brimstone's loyalty to the corporation's vision meanwhile still remained. But when it was not agents of Omega's for once but Kingdom themselves who posed a risk of causing a catastrophe on Alpha, Brimstone found his feelings being tested. When two of the Protocol's latest recruits arrived having recently been involved with a Kingdom project called ''Landfall'', Brimstone wasn't ready to make an enemy out of Kingdom, adamant that all they did was for their mission to make the world better and safer, despite growing concerns about what exactly Kingdom was up to. But when it was discovered that the corporation was using a portal to access the interverse and that doing so risked a major radivore invasion, Brimstone was left with no choice but to have it shut down. Initially unable to convince ex-colleagues of the imminent danger and the need for ''Landfall'' to be abandoned, Brimstone then personally led a mission straight to the facility in Los Angeles where the portal was located, and the Protocol shut it down for good. Though that mission achieved its goal, its aftermath left Brimstone heavily conflicted. While the gateway to the interverse had been closed, the way VALORANT had needed to shut down the portal had caused it to explode, creating a massive sinkhole that now threatened to grow larger and engulf the entire neighborhood. Brimstone himself had also had to fight against his former employer, after all the years he had spent believing in their vision, making him feel as if he had betrayed them with his actions against them. But, just as Brimstone looks out for his team of agents, so too are they looking out for him. With the support of colleagues both new and old, Brimstone now looks to pick up the pieces from ''Landfall'''s demise, and he now has a renewed focus on what needs to come next. Kingdom may have said they would make the world a safer place, but what's truly needed to keep Alpha safe is for Brimstone and the Protocol to deal with the real enemy - the agents of Omega. |-| Timeline of events= ====LIAM BYRNE: Early Life==== *Byrne has several links to Baltimore, Maryland. *Byrne serves as a firefighter for the BFD, Engine 8. *Byrne serves as a soldier for Special Forces in a squad called the Ragged Ravens. *Byrne knew people called Tariq Porter and Sumaira. **He had to watch Tariq die, despite his best efforts to save him. *Byrne works for K-SEC ====BRIMSTONE: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its first agent and commander. **Brimstone worked with to set up the organization.[https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/nrjner/valorant_narrative_team_ama_on_lore_11am_pt12pm_pt/h0h1bkn/?context=3 Reddit Lore AMA - VALORANT's Founders] ====The Omega Project==== *Brimstone encounters on a mission with , leading to Fabron's recruitment into VALORANT. *Brimstone is present during the training exercise at VALORANT HQ. **He arrives towards the end of the exercise to summon the agents for their next mission. ====The Blackmailer==== *Brimstone is involved with the interrogation of . **He is reported to be joining in multiple meetings with the blackmailer that are being kept need-to-know. *After facing questions from agents who hadn't been given the clearance to know about the blackmailer's capture, Brimstone sends an email to all agents informing them about what had happened. *After completing their interrogations, Brimstone concludes that the blackmailer could actually be an ally and agent of VALORANT now that it had been understood that the Protocol had nothing to do with who she was meant to be chasing after.

We save who we can, that's enough"|Brimstone to Sage}} The oldest of the group, Brimstone is a commander with a long history of wearing a uniform, but as if teaching from age and experience wasn't enough to prove his place in leading an organization composed of unique individuals who are each an elite in their own right, then perhaps continuing to work with boots on the ground sealed the deal. As commander of VALORANT and its most senior member, Brimstone always encourages his teammates whenever he can, and does not seem to obligate his subordinates to speak in a formal or professional manner that is usually seen in the military; this is notable as he refers to the younger agents as "kids." Additionally, Brimstone describes himself to be stubborn, and is quite adamant in not letting age get him into retirement anytime soon. ===Appearance=== Brimstone is a tall and large man who is commonly seen wearing a blue shirt with a chest plate over it. He wears an orange beret which notably has a gold-colored insignia that depicts two inverted chevrons, possibly referring to his military rank. Brimstone sports a gray mustache and a heavily grown beard. He wears gloves on both hands, and an arm bracer on his left wrist.

If he gets himself in a sticky situation caused by his own impatience, he is more than capable of quickly adapting to the circumstances and turning the tables around, before rubbing it in the faces of teammates who initially doubted him. His lack of patience is only confirmed by , who reminds him to learn the virtue before they can enjoy a strategic game of chess. However, Phoenix does take his allies' insights into consideration as shown in "," wherein he rethinks his strategy after noted that sacrifice plays for victory's sake was initially not the Brit's style. Despite Phoenix's hasty ways, he is known as a prodigy (claiming that it wasn't his own words), and he always proves it one way or another. ===Appearance=== Phoenix is a dark skinned, youthful tall man of Afro-British descent who wears a black long sleeve shirt with a white Phoenix graphic underneath his white jacket. He wears dark baggy pants with straps that hold bullets shells and a pair of black sneakers that have white soles and orange laces. His jacket notably has fiery-colored lighting on its inside. His hair is in short black dreadlocks, bright orange dyed tips and shaved sides. Phoenix's facial features are undoubtedly sharp, having a strong jawline with high cheekbones. He also accessorizes with gold earrings and a ring with a crown emblem that matches the patch on the right shoulder of his jacket. In the Cinematic, Phoenix instead wears a dark green long sleeve shirt with a crown graphic in the center under his jacket, which he reveals that he buys in bulk. ==Abilities== ===Passive=== ===Basic === ===Signature === ===Ultimate==='''Jett''' is an in '''' and one of the first s available to play since the . ==Profile== ===Biography=== Biography = A from Seoul, South Korea, Han Sunwoo (Korean: íì ì°) had her life forever changed by one person - her from . As a chef in her early life, Han was shot and hunted down by Î©-Jett outside the restaurant she worked at. In the ensuing fight, a "freak storm" was caused as a result of the wind-powered abilities of the two Hans that all but destroyed the restaurant. Î±-Han was forced to flee the scene soon after she made it out of the encounter. Later on, Han would be recruited by the , becoming the Jett of her own world. While working for the Protocol however, Î©-Jett arrived once more and in that destroyed part of the city. With the general population however being completely oblivious about how their world had divided from Omega after , when authorities investigated footage and found someone with Î±-Jett's exact resemblance at the scene, it was her they issued an arrest warrant for. Though Î±-Jett had not had anything to do with the mission, the rest of the world now believed that she was a threat to them. She couldn't explain that it wasn't her to those she know outside of VALORANT, who were left feeling feeling disgusted, horrified, and ashamed at her, and Jett forcing her to go on the run once more. Unable to reveal any info associated with the VALORANT Protocol and unable to convince anyone of her innocence in a population that knows nothing of alternate s, to the rest of Alpha Jett remains one of its most dangerous radiants. Such a judgement had forced Jett to use disguises whenever she would go out, but more recently the frustration has become too much for Jett to care anymore whether she's spotted or not. Most of the Protocol don't have too much to say about their counterparts, but for Jett, what her own has put her through has made it become deeply personal to her. |-| Timeline of events= ====HAN SUNWOO: Early Life==== *Han has links to the Insa-dong neighborhood of Seoul. *Han works for a restaurant as a chef. *Han is targeted by her . **A "freak storm" is caused in the ensuing fight that all but destroys the restaurant, forcing Î±-Han to go on the run. ====JETT: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its tenth agent. *Jett is forced to go on the run once more in the aftermath of the . ** was the perpetrator, but with the general population knowing nothing about Omega, their suspicions turned to Î±-Jett instead. *Jett is assigned as a member of the Thimphu strike team. **She is able to kill Î©-Cypher and Î©-Killjoy as the team struggles to hold the site. **Once Phoenix rejoins the team after he went off in a different direction upon Legion's initial arrival, Jett goes on a counter push with him against the remaining Legion agents, killing Î©-Skye. ====The Omega Project==== *Jett is present during the training exercise at VALORANT HQ. **Jett is one of the agents to fight against Max Bot, whilst also losing large amounts of credits to in several bets that Max Bot would lose a fight. ====The Blackmailer==== * Jett contacts with concerns over the recruitment of into VALORANT just after the Turk had appeared dedicated to taking down the organization and exposing all of its agents. ====Project Landfall==== *Jett travels to Los Angeles to investigate reports of weird things spotted near a Kingdom facility also involving "strangers in the night". *Jett has a meal with , , and . *Jett goes undercover operating a surveillance truck that covers as a food truck serving Kingdom employees, reporting back to Brimstone when she overhears talks about cargo pickups in Norway. **Also working alongside , his behavior soon begins to drive Jett crazy. *Jett uses Protocol funds on an expensive meal she has with Gekko. *Jett voices frustrations about having to stay out of public or use disguises in order to go out into the world. ====Scions of Hourglass==== *Jett is assigned to a strike team defending from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha. *Jett tracks an from a specialized containment cell. *Jett is assigned as a member of the Seoul strike team. ===Personality=== "Think you can keep up? Who am I kidding? You know you can't keep up."|Jett (Match Start)}} The wind is commonly known for being cool, but Jett is an aggressive agent who has a distinctive, sarcastic personality. Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount of arrogance. Her self-confidence may feel as if she is disregarding her comrades' safety, but she has recognized that it is best to play with a team, albeit with some reluctance. She does show a much more friendly personality towards teammates. Her youth is apparent as she animatedly chats with her allies, and she can sometimes spitball whenever she's excited to share ideas. ===Appearance=== Jett is a fair-skinned, young woman, and one of the shortest of the Protocol agents. She has white hair, which she ties in a bun on the back. Her bangs are rather long and remain stably locked. Her eyes are a shade of blue, and she looks like she wears eyeliner. Jett's armor has multiple symbols associated with wind such as the swirl on her right shoulder pad. Her blue, sleeveless jacket features a stylized depiction of the logo through some clouds. The icons on the backs of her gloves is the same icon on the lip of her hoodie and bottom edge of her crop top. A sash and two kunai can be seen along her right hip belt. Jett's shoes have a triangular whirl on the outer side of the heel and a smooth "V" stamped on the back heel. When using her radiant powers to manipulate the wind, whorls of white air wrap around Jett's arms as markings.

However, news of what Callas and Kingdom were about to uncover reached the , an organization that already secretly knew about radianite and didn't want its existence to become public knowledge again to . Hourglass proceeded to send their most talented asset, the assassin "", to kill Callas. On the day of the attempted assassination however while Callas was working in her lab, she was able to defend herself, with Ghost being hit in the face by a vial of chemicals she had been holding before he had then ended up being trapped in a test chamber that Callas proceeded to activate while he was still inside. Everything changed for Callas after the incident. She became more isolated, shedding all the pieces of her life in the name of vengeance. Ghost meanwhile had been transformed by the process he had gone through in the test chamber to become a phantom without any memory of who he used to be. Seeing an opportunity to keep her would-be killer contained, Callas lied to him about knowing anything of his past, allowing him to work alongside her instead. Eventually, the two would go on to leave Kingdom upon the founding of the secretive , alongside fellow Kingdom colleague . With Byrne becoming the organization's commander, "Brimstone", Callas took the call sign "Viper" and became his second-in-command, while Ghost became its third agent "Omen". Viper would go on to be involved with the recruitment of new agents and has been active in many of their missions, operating in places like and against the threat to Alpha. More recently however, Omen has since come to discover who he was and that Viper has been keeping this from him all this time, leading to a new animosity between the two. Omen's search for answers though have now put VALORANT into conflict with Viper's old enemy, the Scions of Hourglass. As the Protocol as a whole looks to investigate the SoH for its activities both before and after the modern rediscovery of radianite, its new focus on them may give Viper the chance at last to deliver vengeance against the organization that wanted her dead all those years ago. |-| Timeline of events = ====SABINE CALLAS: Early Life==== *Callas has links to Seattle. *Callas gains a doctorate. *Callas becomes the youngest recipient of the R.

Shall I prove them right?"|Viper (Match Start)}} Viper is a savage and confident agent who doesn't fear enemies, and in fact desires the enemies' fear. She does not hesitate to call herself a villain and a monster, and will act like both if it means the success of her objective. Just like her abilities, she can be quite "toxic", however she is seen being more amiable and caring towards her teammates, but she will not hesitate to reprimand them harshly should they make major miscalculations in the battlefield. Several agents have observed that Viper bottles a lot of violent anger within her. Viper has implied that her enemies have taken many things from her, and that she will stop at nothing to achieve her revenge. ===Appearance=== Attracting attention with her jet black hair and venom green eyes, Viper also has a black mask.

I must keep my secrets with me.|Cypher (Match Start)}} Cypher is constantly gathering secrets, information, and intel, to the point of managing to retrieve the passwords of everyone in the VALORANT Protocol. His continued passion to gather whatever information he can find is not always shared by his teammates, as Jett found out the hard way during an undercover mission in Los Angeles. He keeps most of this information to himself, making sure that no one ever discovers them and only revealing anything he knows for a price. In contrast of how he knows a lot about his allies, they do not know much about him, and he prefers to keep it that way. While Cypher has a history of being a killer, he has shown to have warmer ties with some of the agents in the Protocol, to the point of referring to them by nicknames; for example, he refers to as 'little engineer', as 'little star', and as 'wind assassin', among others. A calculated person who enjoys a game of chess, Cypher is known to be rather observant towards others, as seen when he noted that sacrifice plays for victory's sake was not Phoenix's usual engagement style. He is also known to be rather cheeky, and tends to take parts or tools from his fellow agents whenever he needs them, often informing them later on that he has done so rather than asking them if he can use them beforehand. ===Appearance=== Cypher's overall appearance resembles a typical depiction of a detective or gumshoe. His main piece of apparel is a large, white coat that extends from his shins up to his neck. This overcoat is where he keeps his utility stored. He wears dull grey pants, which are paired with black shoes. Gold, brown, and blue colors accentuate his predominantly black and white color scheme. Notably, not a single inch of Cypher's skin is directly visible. Aside from his coat and pants, Cypher wears a pair of blue gloves that have a bright glow at the center of the palm, which serves as a magnet and allows for Cypher to recall any of his utilities back to his hand at will. Undoubtedly, the most defining part of his wardrobe is his characteristic mask with hexagonal eye holes that hold a bright blue glow. This mask is high tech and is confirmed to be "vision-specific."[https://twitter.com/NotToDisturb/status/1421271788126969865 ''VALORANT'' Lore Discord Narrative AMA: Cypher's eyes] Cypher wears a hat with an antenna attached to it.

Firstly working alongside Dr. (one of his only apparent links to who he used to be) at , he would then go on join her in the founding of the . During his time as a secret agent, Omen was driven by his search to discover who he previously was. Without answers he was unable to find peace, his predicament being only a nightmare for him to live in. It was then after over a decade of time that a path towards the truth finally appeared when the Protocol came across an symbol after one of their missions, something that immediately triggered a sense of recognition in Omen. Soon after, VALORANT then ended up meeting the person responsible for this symbol appearing, the young assassin , who was recruited into the organization as "Iso". At first it was hard to get much information out of Iso as he shut down many queries about his own past, but eventually he came forward with his own truth; he had still been working undercover for his former employer, the Scions of Hourglass, and he had joined VALORANT in order to access his next target: Omen. It was only after seeing the differences between the two organizations that Iso had chosen to truly defect from Hourglass instead as he had initially pretended to, and now he wanted to join in VALORANT's investigation into the SoH to uncover more about them. For Omen specifically however, it was an opportunity to finally get some answers on his past, starting with why this organization, one that Iso said that Omen used to work for too, wanted him dead. Intel eventually led to Protocol to an Hourglass skyscraper base in Jakarta where Iso's former boss was. While VALORANT sent a full strike team to confront and interrogate the boss, Omen was entrusted with carrying this out personally, entering the base alone while the other agents provided support. Going through every guard on his way up to the penthouse, Omen found the boss there and confronted him, but was trapped by the boss within a device that he had set up, using a beam of energy to start ripping him apart. In what was meant to be Omen's final moments, the boss was happy to oblige with Omen's demand for answers, revealing that Omen had been Hourglass' most talented assets in their former mission to keep the substance from being rediscovered, as an assassin known as "Ghost". But the boss' taunting triggered something more in Omen, as more memories of his past began to return. He could suddenly remember the last day before he had changed completely and what he had been doing. As Ghost, he had been sent on a mission to kill Sabine Callas, his old Kingdom colleague and now his fellow Protocol agent "Viper", just as she and Kingdom had been about to rediscover radianite. That last day was the moment of the assassination attempt, but he realized he had failed. Dr. Callas had been able to defended herself, while a vial of chemicals she had been holding had hit Ghost in the face, before he had then ended up becoming trapped within a nearby test chamber. As he had tried to break out, Dr. Callas had then activated it, with the process then turning him from a man into the phantom that he was now. Omen had been left with no memory of this upon his transformation, but Viper had known this whole time. Just as the boss then moved to finish Omen off though in the midst of all of this, the device containing him was destroyed by the strike team, freeing Omen to grab the boss and take him through the window, leaving him to fall to his death. After the events in Jakarta, Omen now has the truth behind how he came to be, but it has only led to more questions and frustration, with Omen finding himself unfocused instead of at peace as he thought he would be once he got his answers. Now needing to find his own path in light of what he has uncovered, Omen has stepped away from the Protocol for now while he recovers. But no matter who he used to be, Omen has since made a new family in VALORANT, and he knows he will return to them in time. |-| Timeline of events = ====GHOST: Early life==== *Ghost goes under several other aliases over his life. **These include Dmitri, Fred, John, Marcus, and Yohan. *Ghost works for the . *Ghost is assigned to assassinate . **He fails in his attempt as Callas defends herself, with a vial of chemicals she was holding hitting him in the face. **He then ends up trapped within a test chamber that Callas activates, with the result turning him from a man into a phantom without any memory of who he was. * Ghost is later involved with . ====OMEN: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its third agent. **Omen plays an important part in the organization's founding and why it was set up.[https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/nrjner/valorant_narrative_team_ama_on_lore_11am_pt12pm_pt/h0gy8h6/?context=10000 Reddit Narrative AMA: Omen's links to VP's founding] *Omen enters into a transaction with wherein he asks him to find information regarding "hard to find answers". **He is yet to pay Cypher in order for the intel broker to reveal to him what he has discovered. ====First ventures into Omega==== *Omen is assigned to keep track of a convoy that is pursuing . **He delivers a report after Batra flees from Bhutan. ====Journey into the City of Flowers==== *Omen attempts to call , but accidentally connects to Brimstone's number instead. ====Project Landfall==== *Omen reports that has been displaying strange behavior, including increased awareness and independence, and recommends that Killjoy and Raze revert his modified programming. **He later has suspicions towards Raze over her stealing fuel, which the Brazilian denies. **Max Bot then goes missing, with Omen imploring Brimstone to act on the situation. **After Max Bot reveals his betrayal when he hijacks the Protocol's teleporter, Omen contacts Brimstone to tell him "I told you so". ====Scions of Hourglass==== *Omen recognizes an hourglass symbol discovered by the Protocol in their investigation into the disappearance of Landfall's leadership. **He has sessions with and to attempt to restore his memories about the symbol, but they aren't successful **He asks Cypher and to keep him informed about any further developments in the investigation.

One of ''VALORANT'''s best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at short to medium range where it is able to spray down multiple enemies at once due to its high rate of fire. It also comes equipped with a silencer, allowing it to be used to spam through s without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning. The Phantom is able to instantly kill an enemy with a single headshot, but its damage falloff means this no longer becomes the case at medium to long ranges. Players hitting the initial headshot but failing to hit a second killing shot before they die themselves may find the preferable in such situations.The Ghost is a low-cost semi-automatic pistol. Equipped with a large magazine and a silencer, it can be used to spam through s without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning. Whilst proficient at all ranges, it is especially good for picking off long-range enemies, though at shorter ranges it does not offer much more power than a outside of pistol rounds. Compared to the costlier , the Ghost is less powerful in pistol rounds but isn't too far behind in power when used against fully-ed enemies unless you can hit your headshots. The Ghost's higher fire rate, larger magazine capacity, and lower max spread also make it more forgiving if the player misses some of their shots.The Frenzy is a low-cost automatic pistol. As a sidearm equivalent of an SMG, it's not too punishing to use on the move at short ranges, making it most effective at that range and the best sidearm to use in such scenarios, though to challenge enemies who have full-bought getting headshots will most likely be necessary. Its high rate of fire and small magazine size however means it will run out quickly and, unless controlled exceptionally well, isn't great at taking out multiple enemies at once. This makes it especially risky to spray through s with if using it during a pistol or eco round as the player is much more likely to run out of ammo than most other weapons.The Vandal is a high-cost automatic rifle. One of ''VALORANT'''s best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at picking off individual targets at longer ranges due to having no falloff, allowing it to kill any enemy with a single headshot at all ranges. Compared to ''VALORANT'''s other general-purpose rifle, the , the Vandal is guaranteed to instantly kill an enemy with one bullet to the head whereas the Phantom's damage falloff results in it requiring multiple bullets at medium to long range to get headshot kills. However, the Phantom's higher fire rate and accuracy make it better at taking on multiple enemies at short to medium ranges over the Vandal.The Bucky is a low-cost shotgun and the cheapest primary weapon in the game. It has two firing modes, a standard single-shell primary fire and a canister alternate fire that allows the shell to travel a short distance before spraying its pellets instead of immediately spraying from the barrel of the gun, allowing the user to deal some damage to targets at medium range. Shells shot using Alternate Fire only produce a reduced amount of pellets however, and enemies hit by the canister before it reaches the required distance to explode will only take 1 pellet worth of damage. As a pump action shotgun, the Bucky is reloaded one shell at a time. Because the Bucky's reload time is also shorter than it's fire rate, this means that a user can reload a shell in between shots, effectively increasing the magazine's capacity to the entire available reserve. As with all shotguns due to their pellet spread, the Bucky is effectively useless at long ranges, as well having the range of its pellets capped and unable to reach any opponent beyond 50 meters (Alt Fire measures this distance from where the canister explodes instead). The Bucky especially has a low fire rate, meaning it cannot effectively be used against multiple enemies at once, which is a task better served by the Bucky's direct upgrade, the .The Classic is a pistol that all players receive upon spawning. It has two firing modes, a standard semi-automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic shotgun alternate fire that fires three bullets instantly but only at around a third of its usual fire rate. Despite what may be suggested about its strength by the Classic being the gun given away for free, it is actually a versatile sidearm. Whilst the other sidearms are usually suited for a particular range, the Classic can be used in medium range engagements thanks to its large falloff range but can also quickly dispatch an enemy at close range using its shotgun mode. If a player isn't expecting to take fights at one specific range, the Classic's versatility can entice them into keeping it over upgrading to another sidearm, allowing them to use their on or instead.The Shorty is the cheapest purchasable weapon in the game. As a sidearm equivalent of a shotgun, it is most effective at short range to instantly take an enemy by surprise. With good damage and functionality despite its low price tag, it can even be used to catch out a fully-bought enemy in eco rounds, allowing the player to gain a powerful weapon upgrade for very little investment. As happens with all shotguns due to their pellet spread though, the Shorty is effectively useless at long ranges, as well having the range of its pellets capped and unable to reach any opponent beyond 50 meters. The Shorty especially also has limited use due to its high pellet spread at medium range and only being able to hold 2 shells at a time, meaning it cannot effectively be used in sustained firefights against multiple enemies.The Sheriff is a semi-automatic revolver and the most expensive sidearm in the game. Able to kill enemies with a single bullet to the head at most ranges and health totals, it can be used to challenge even enemies who have full-bought. It's high penetration and extra reserve magazine also makes it useful for spamming for wallbangs during pistol or eco rounds. With a low-capacity magazine and low fire rate however, even one missed shot can end up being punishing. The Sheriff's high recoil and spread also promotes exceptional control and precision in order to use it when fighting multiple enemies.The Bulldog is a moderately-priced rifle. It has two firing modes, a standard automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic burst-mode alternate fire that fires three bullets in an accurate burst at around a fifth of its usual fire rate. The Bulldog can be a good option when you're not saving but the rest of your team has stronger buys for the round whilst you don't have the to buy a more expensive rifle. However, all the other rifles are upgrades over the Bulldog when they can be purchased; players looking to tap heads with the Bulldog's burst fire can use the instead, with higher accuracy, damage, and penetration, whilst general short-mid range combat is better suited for the and with their higher rates of fire.The Guardian is a moderately-priced semi-automatic rifle. It is highly effective in long-range fights in the hands of players who are confident in their ability to hit headshots at such distances, being more accurate than a . The Guardian's high penetration makes it solid for wallbanging, often being a one-tap headshot. However, it's lower firerate and magazine capacity compared to the or makes the gun less viable for breaking enemy utility, or spraying down opponents on close range.The Judge is a moderately-priced automatic shotgun. It is best used in situations that put the user in close range against multiple enemies, being able to wipe them out quickly should they risk not clearing such small areas beforehand. As with all shotguns, the Judge has pellet spread that can be reduced by crouching, though the spread still makes it effectively useless at long ranges no matter what. Unlike the other shotguns however, the Judge does not have a distance cap on its pellets and can hit enemies beyond 50 meters. As a more expensive shotgun and expected upgrade to the , the Judge's higher rate of fire makes it a better option for taking on multiple enemies at once. However, the Judge's lower effective magazine capacity and lower damage makes the Bucky a more suitable choice in sustained firefights or for taking out individual targets.The Marshal is a low cost sniper rifle. As a sniper, it has a scope with a single zoom setting on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. Despite sniper rifles usually being extremely inaccurate when used in Primary Fire mode, the Marshal is surprisingly accurate in this case, meaning it can be used to take on multiple enemies at once so long as the user can hit their shots. As a lever action sniper rifle, the Marshal is reloaded one bullet at a time. Because the Marshal's reload time is also shorter than it's fire rate, this means that a user can reload a bullet in between shots, effectively increasing the magazine's capacity to the entire available reserve. Compared to the costlier and , the Marshal can be better overall at fighting multiple enemies with its higher fire rate and magazine capacity, but this would require exceptional aim from the user as they will need to hit headshots instead. The Operator meanwhile deals much more damage that allows it to instantly kill enemies with a body shot as well as headshots, whereas the Marshal can only do this against enemies.The Operator is a high-cost sniper rifle and the most expensive gun in the game. As a sniper, it has a scope with two zoom settings on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. The Operator's Primary Fire accuracy on the other hand is extremely inaccurate. The Operator's power comes from its high-damage bullets, being able to instantly kill any enemy with a single shot to the body, though with its low rate of fire every missed shot comes with a cost. Compared to the and the , both of which cannot kill fully ed enemies with a single body shot, the Operator is also better at picking off enemies with a wallbang shot than the Marshal due to its higher penetration, though the Outlaw's higher fire rate can make it a better choice instead for this if an additional shot is needed.The Stinger is a low-cost SMG. It has two firing modes, a standard automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic burst-mode alternate fire that fires four bullets in a burst at around an eighth of its usual fire rate. As an SMG, the Stinger is most effective at shorter range or when used on the move. It's high fire rate makes it great for taking out single targets when buying light and can be used to surprise an enemy in tight spaces, allowing the player to gain a weapon upgrade for little investment thanks to the Stinger's cheap cost. Compared to the costlier SMG, the Stinger is not completely outshone as its power comes with its ability to kill individual agents quickly. However, the Stinger's lower magazine capacity and higher fire rate make it unsuitable for sustained firefights against multiple enemies, given that a magazine will empty in just over a second. Its higher spread values also mean the Spectre can have more precision when looking to eliminate single targets at longer ranges, meaning the Stinger is more suited to fights in close-quarters. Also, despite ADS and burst often being associated with better precision at long range, the Stinger's alternate fire is affected by recoil within the burst itself, meaning exceptional control is needed to ensure all of the burst's bullets hit the target at longer ranges.The Spectre is a moderately-priced SMG. Equipped with a large magazine and a silencer, it can be used to spam through s without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning. As an SMG, the Spectre is most effective at shorter range or when used on the move, though it has decent stats and features all-round to make it usable at medium to long range as well. As a more expensive SMG and expected upgrade to the , the Spectre's higher magazine capacity and accuracy makes it a better option for eliminating single targets at longer ranges or in sustained firefights against multiple enemies. However, the Spectre's lower fire rate makes the Stinger a more suitable choice for killing individual agents at close range. In comparison to the similarly-priced , the Spectre has more mobility and lower initial spread but cannot compete with an Ares player in a sustained firefight, though the Spectre is quicker at wiping out enemies with headshots at close range.The Odin is a high-cost machine gun. When using Primary Fire, the Odin's fire rate will increase over the duration the weapon is fired to a maximum amount, but using Alternate Fire will allow the user to shoot at that maximum fire rate immediately. As a machine gun, the Odin is most effective as either a defensive tool to hold a site or when used to get wallbang kills due to its high penetration, rate of fire, and magazine capacity. Their lower mobility and longer equip speeds however make them less suited for peeking or entering sites, something better served at such a price by rifles like the or . As a more expensive machine gun compared to the , the Odin is a direct upgrade, offering more damage, higher rates of fire, and higher initial accuracy, with the only benefit to the Ares being its unique reverse accuracy feature. However, these upgrades come at a heavy cost, with the Odin being the second-most expensive weapon in the game, more than any rifle.The Ares is a medium-cost machine gun. Unlike most other guns that gets less accurate as you continuously fire more bullets from them, the Ares is the only gun in the game that gets more accurate as it is continuously fired. As a machine gun, it is most effective as either a defensive tool to hold a site or when used to get wallbang kills due to its high penetration, rate of fire, and magazine capacity. Their lower mobility and longer equip speeds however make them less suited for peeking or entering sites, something better served by SMGs at the price of an Ares. In comparison to the similarly-priced , the Ares is better at a distance due to its low damage falloff but cannot compete with a Spectre player who can hit their headshots at close range. The Ares is also less mobile and has much more initial spread. Compared to the costlier , the Ares is not completely outshone thanks to its unique reverse accuracy feature. However, the Odin's higher damage, fire rate, and initial accuracy far outweigh the benefits of the Ares, though a heavy price will need to be paid for the upgrade.'''''' is a in '''' and one of the first available since the . ==Features== Bind's unique feature is that it doesn't contain a mid section, instead having two one-way teleporters. One takes players from A Short to B Short and the other takes players from B Long to A Lobby. Players use teleporters by walking into the section of wall taken up by the teleport entrance. They will then instantly arrive in a small exit room which players leave by walking towards the door out of the room. This door is closed by default and can only be opened by players inside the exit room walking up to it, at which point they will open automatically. Players outside the exit room cannot open these doors, but they can be penetrated by gunfire. Other objects can also be sent through teleporters if they come into contact with the teleporter entrance. They will maintain any velocity they had before being teleported and can open the doors and leave the exit room should they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor. Objects include abilities, the , and dropped . Whenever a teleporter is used by an or an object, all players on the map will be given an audio cue. ==Map== ==Cosmetics== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | | // Bind + Icebox | |- | |Dropoff | |- | |Crying Sage | |- | |Pixel Moments | |} {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |In A Bind | |} ==Lore== : ''See also: What has Kingdom done to this town?!

Upon casting she throws forward a slow orb that detonates on contact with horizontal terrain, covering a surrounding area in radianite crystals. Any who come into contact with these crystals are and give off an audio cue whenever they run or jump across the zone. Once it expires, the zone will rapidly dissipate. Slow Orb Equip.png|Equip Slow Orb Cast.png|Cast Slow Orb Activation.png|ActivationBarrier Orb is primarily a ability that must equip before casting. Once equipped, her crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a wall. Upon first equip the indicator will be oriented to be perpendicular to the direction Sage is facing. Sage can recast the ability to rotate this indicator 90Â°. Using Alternate Fire allows her to have full control over the exact angle the indicator is positioned in. Recasting the ability after using Alternate Fire will reset the indicator to a perpendicular or linear position. If Sage unequips Barrier Orb, the orientation of the indicator upon reequipping will be the same as it was when she unequipped the ability. Upon activation, a wall containing multiple segments will rise up from the ground, blocking line of sight and preventing anything from passing through them. A segment will not be created if it would not be in contact with any horizontal terrain. The segments each have their own health amount, which will increase after being allowed to fortify a few seconds after forming. Enemies can destroy a segment by dealing enough damage to it to deplete its health using or some damaging . Towards the end of the wall's duration the health of any remaining segments will each begin to decay for a percentage of their remaining health. Segments with less health than others will not expire before them, and all remaining segments will expire simultaneously. Barrier Orb Equip.png|Equip Barrier Orb Cast.png|Cast Barrier Orb Activation.png|ActivationHealing Orb is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, Sage selects an ally who is damaged to receive a heal-over-time. Sage can use Primary and Alt Fire to choose who she targets. Primary Fire targets an ally in her crosshairs whilst Alt Fire targets herself with a weaker healing effect. To target an ally, they must be in Sage's line of sight. The healing effect is briefly paused if the target takes damage.

As he was a double congenital amputee however, the judge was pitiful and lenient towards him, giving him a smaller sentence that soon allowed Erik to return to his old ways. Building himself his own mechanical arms to use, Erik would hit back with his own criminal assignments, becoming so notorious for the terrible things he had done that he eventually had to go into hiding and effectively exile himself from his home. During these times, he also encountered the young Brazilian , who worked alongside him for a while and provided some major upgrades to his arms, resulting in the carbon-steel titanium-plating version that he uses to this day. Later approached to become a VALORANT agent, Torsten accepted the offer though his induction was not a smooth affair. Leaving behind his criminal life in line with VP procedure, his records were sealed and he became the Protocol's thirteenth agent, "Breach". Despite now serving for the secret organization with more dignified actions however, the consequences of his criminal past forever remain, leaving him a man that, for all he does now, can still never truly return home. |-| Timeline of events = ====ERIK TORSTEN: Early Life==== *Torsten is separated from his family when they were imprisoned.

This bionic man has hinted at having a long history of being in the battlefield, and any shootout is always fun for him. He mainly treats his current occupation in VALORANT as nothing more than another post wherein he drops into the fight, wins, and gets paid. However, he's also looking for excitement and will not hesitate to wreck havoc along the way. According to in his voicelines, Breach lacks patience and tends to rush into fights while leaving his team behind. The Swede has also earned the ire of for being a loudmouth who doesn't shut up. With his gimmick for aggression, Breach believes in getting the job done quick, and when the guns are being held up on his face, that's when he knows that it's just another Tuesday. ===Appearance=== Breach is a tall man with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, while sporting a beard and a mustache. He is most noticeable with his metal arms that are made out of carbon steel with titanium plating. He wears a green vest that covers a black shirt that sports a red logo of a horned demon.

Run It Back Cast.png|Cast Run It Back Marker.png|Marker Run It Back Dissipate.png|Timeout/Killed Run It Back Revive.png|ReviveBlaze is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, he will create a line of flames that moves forward along horizontal ground. The line of flames can be affected in two ways; it can be curved in a direction by holding the activation key and moving your crosshair in the direction you want the line to bend, and its length can be decreased by changing the angle you are looking in on cast. Looking straight ahead will cast the ability at max length, whilst looking directly up or down will cast the ability at minimum length. Once the line of flames has reached its target distance or collides with vertical terrain, a wall of flame will start to rise from Phoenix's location, spreading across the length of the line until it reaches maximum distance. will begin to take damage as soon as the flame wall reaches an area they are standing on. The wall will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they are closer to Phoenix's cast location compared to a player who was further away on cast. Once the wall reaches its maximum length, it will continue damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole wall will rapidly fall. Phoenix is affected by '''Heating Up''' if he comes into contact with the wall.Hot Hands is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting he will throw a fireball that detonates as soon as it comes into contact with horizontal terrain. Phoenix can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the fireball at long range whilst Alt Fire throws it at short range. Unlike most thrown projectiles that will naturally arc through the air when thrown until they hit terrain, Hot Hands has a set timer. If the fireball is still in the air after this time, it will immediately drop down vertically instead until it hits horizontal terrain. Upon detonation, the fireball will create a damaging zone that quickly spreads out from the point of detonation in a circular area of effect. will begin to take damage as soon as the zone spreads to an area they are standing on. The zone will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they were at the center of the zone on detonation compared to a player who was closer to the edge of the zone on detonation. Once the zone reaches its maximum radius, it will continue damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole zone will instantly dissipate. Phoenix is affected by '''Heating Up''' if he comes into contact with the zone.Blade Storm is an ability that can instantly use. Upon activation, she winds up and equips herself with throwing knives. Jett can use other abilities and weapons without deactivating Blade Storm; she can re-use the ability to reequip the knives. Blade Storm has two firing modes, Single and Burst. Single Fire throws knives one by one, has 100% accuracy at all times (even when Jett is running or in the air), and will fully recharge her ammunition count if she kills an enemy. Burst Fire throws all of Blade Storm's remaining knives, though this can be inaccurate and will not grant a recharge even if she kills an enemy. Blade Storm Summon.png|Summon Blade Storm Equip.png|Equip Blade Storm Primary Fire.png|Primary fire Blade Storm Alt Fire.png|Alt fireShock Bolt is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon doing so, he will equip himself with a bow that holds an explosive arrow. Sova can control the number of times this arrow can bounce off of terrain using Alt Fire and affect its range by holding Fire. The arrow has four fixed ranges that it can be fired in, displayed as a charge bar under the crosshair. The arrow enters a higher range as soon as the charge bar begins to fill up one of the bars, reaching maximum range once all three bars are filled. Whilst charging, Sova can recast the ability to reset the charge bar and allow him to safely release his Fire key without firing the arrow. Upon releasing his Fire key, Sova will fire the arrow forward. Upon contact with any surface, the arrow will bounce against it depending on how many bounces have been added to it. If no more bounces are available to be used on a collision, the arrow will detonate, dealing damage in a spherical area of effect. The detonation has an outer radius and an inner radius. Anything within the inner radius will take full damage. Once in the outer radius, the amount of damage begins to fall off to a minimum at the very edge. Shock Bolt Equip.png|Equip Shock Bolt Cast.png|Cast Shock Bolt Activation.png|ActivationRecon Bolt is an ability that must equip before casting. Upon doing so he will equip himself with a bow that holds a recon arrow. Sova can control the number of times this arrow can bounce off of terrain using Alt Fire and affect its range by holding Fire. The arrow has four fixed ranges that it can be fired in, displayed as a charge bar under the crosshair. The arrow enters a higher range as soon as the charge bar begins to fill up one of the bars, reaching maximum range once all three bars are filled. Whilst charging, Sova can recast the ability to reset the charge bar and allow him to safely release his Fire key without firing the arrow. Upon releasing his Fire key Sova will fire the arrow forward. Upon contact with any surface the arrow will bounce against it depending on how many bounces have been added to it. If no more bounces are available to be used on a collision, the arrow will attach to the surface, wind up briefly, then periodically emits sonar pulses over a few seconds. If these pulses hit any enemy that are also in the arrow's line of sight, the enemy will be briefly with a real-time silhouette. Enemies can deal damage to the recon bolt and destroy it. Recon Bolt Equip.png|Equip Recon Bolt Cast.png|Cast Recon Bolt Activation.png|Activation Recon Bolt Reveal.png|RevealOwl Drone is an ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting he deploys an owl drone that he takes control of. Sova's body will remain still in a channeling position whilst using the drone, leaving him vulnerable to enemy gunfire and utility. The drone can fly through the air, is controlled using movement keys, and will self destruct once it expires. If Sova's body takes damage whilst he is in control of Owl Drone, the ability will be ended early. Whilst using Owl Drone, Sova can aim at enemy and fire to shoot marking darts at them.

For all other players, they will see Jett with gusts of wind around her legs and brighter hair. Upon recasting whilst empowered, Jett will dash a fixed distance in the direction she is moving. If Jett is standing still, she will dash forward. Tailwind can be used whilst Jett is in the air. Tailwind Cast.png|Cast Tailwind Activation.png|ActivationUpdraft is a ability that can instantly use. Upon activation, Jett will launch herself upwards. The direction of this dash is vertical but can be further affected by inputting movement commands either before or after using Updraft. The dash height does not exceed the distance required for a player to take fall damage, allowing Jett to land safely after using Updraft even if she does not slow her descent using (so long as her landing location is not at a lower elevation compared to her starting location). Updraft Activation.png|Cast/ActivationCloudburst is a ability that instantly throws forward on activation. Jett can move her crosshair to control the direction that the projectile moves in. Once it hits a surface, or after it has been in the air for a certain amount of time, the projectile expands to create a smoke. Vision within the smoke is obscured. Once it expires, the smoke will instantly dissipate. Cloudburst Cast.png|Cast Cloudburst Activation.png|ActivationPoison Cloud is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she throws an emitter forward that sticks as soon as it comes into contact with a horizontal surface. can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the emitter at long range while Alt Fire throws it at short range. During the buy phase the emitter can be picked up to regain the charge, but once the round has started it cannot be recalled. While deployed, Viper can activate the ability to cause the emitter to create a smoke that rapidly expands from the emitter's location. Vision within the smoke is obscured. While active, the smoke consumes '''Fuel'''. If Viper runs out of fuel, or upon reactivation, the smoke will expire, rapidly shrinking. Viper can then reactivate to reform the smoke once more as long as she has replenished enough fuel to spend. There are short cooldowns between uses whenever Viper turns the smoke on or off. Enemy who come into contact with the smoke are affected by '''Toxin'''.Snake Bite is primarily a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she will throw a canister that detonates as soon as it comes into contact with horizontal terrain. Upon detonation, the canister will create a damaging zone that quickly spreads out from the point of detonation in a circular area of effect. who come into contact with the zone will become and begin to take damage as soon as the zone spreads to an area they are standing on. The zone will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they were at the center of the zone on detonation compared to a player who was closer to the edge of the zone on detonation. Once the zone reaches its maximum radius, it will continue applying Vulnerable and damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole zone will instantly dissipate. Vulnerable doubles any incoming damage agents takes and this includes the damage taken from Snake Bite. The debuff will continue to remain on an agent for a short duration after they exit the area of effect or after it dissipates. Snake Bite Equip.png|Equip Snake Bite Cast.png|Cast Snake Bite Activation.png|ActivationToxic Screen is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she will fire a projectile that will travel forward, piercing through terrain. For every few meters that the projectile travels horizontally, it will drop a gas emitter that falls vertically from the projectile's location until it hits horizontal terrain. All together, this will create a long line of emitters that remain indefinitely. Viper can activate the ability to cause the emitters to create a wall that rapidly rises from the line's location. This will activate sequentially for each emitter, starting with the one that was first placed upon deployment. Enemy who come into contact with the wall will be affected by '''Toxin'''. Whilst active, the wall consumes '''Fuel'''. If Viper runs out of fuel, or upon reactivation, the wall will expire, rapidly falling. Unlike the wall's activation, deactivation happens simultaneously for all emitters. Viper can then reactivate to reform the wall once more as long as she has replenished enough fuel to spend. There are short cooldowns between uses whenever Viper turns the wall on or off.Viper's Pit is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon doing so a circular indicator will appear in front of her. This crosshair will turn green if it is placed over a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. Upon casting, Viper will create a large chemical cloud. This cloud will originate and spread out from her location but once fully formed will have its center at the location that the indicator was in on activation. Once formed, the cloud will remain indefinitely so long as Viper remains inside. If she exits the cloud it will begin to lose integrity, putting it on a timer that will disappear if she reenters the cloud in time, restoring it to full integrity. If Viper does not reenter the cloud before this timer expires, the cloud will expire, causing it to fall down and disappear. Viper herself can cause the ability to end by recasting and holding the ability key. Vision within the cloud is obscured. Enemy who come into contact with the cloud will be affected by '''Toxin'''. Enemies within the cloud will be outlined in red once they enter vision range, have their minimap obscured, and do not provide minimap detection to their allies.Paranoia is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, he throws forward a blinding orb that passes through any terrain. Any or deployed with a field of vision that is hit by the orb will be . Agents will see warning VFX appear on their screen if they are standing in an area the orb will pass through. Paranoia Equip.png|Equip Paranoia Cast.png|Cast Paranoia Activation.png|Activation Paranoia Warning.png|VFX warning Paranoia Nearsighted.png|Shrouded Step is a ability that must equip before casting. Once equipped, his crosshair will be replaced with an indicator that shows a target destination to teleport to. Upon casting, Omen will channel for a short duration, giving off an audio cue at his current location that can be heard by all players. Once this channel completes, he instantly teleports to his target location, giving off a smaller audio cue on arrival. Shrouded Step Equip.png|Equip Shrouded Step Cast.png|Cast Shrouded Step Activation.png|Activation Shrouded Step Activation 3P.png|Activation from other player's perspectiveFrom the Shadows is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon doing so, a display of the entire will appear on Omen's screen. He can click on any part of the map to instantly begin teleporting to that location. This activation will also cause the minimaps of enemy to become obscured for the ability's duration. After a brief windup time, Omen will arrive at his destination as a Shade for a short amount of time. As a Shade, Omen's vision is mostly grayscale and he is inflicted with a reduced vision radius. He will also be rooted in place, though he will still be able to rotate his body, as well as being able to pick up the and interact with any map useables (such as 's rotating doors) if any of these are within range. On immediate arrival his vision radius starts at zero but during his time as a Shade this will gradually increase, the rate of restoration getting quicker towards the end of the Shade's duration until the vision radius cap is completely removed. While he is a Shade, enemy agents can shoot a bullet at him to cancel the teleport, returning Omen to his original position when he activated the ability. Omen can cancel the teleport himself by re-casting the ability while he is a Shade. From the Shadows Equip.png|Equip From the Shadows Cast.png|Cast From the Shadows Activation.png|ActivationDark Cover is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon doing so, he will enter a phased world that is a mirror counterpart of the entire he is currently on. His perspective within this world is centered on a smoke indicator that shows a blue outline of where a smoke will deploy on activation. Omen can use his fire keys to move the marker across the map. In the phased world, Omen's perspective will follow the smoke indicator as it is moved. Omen can still move his real body using his movement keys but will not be able to see his allies nor any walls or roofs. Any enemies however that would appear is his field of view will appear in the phased world with a red outline. Omen will still be able to hear everything happening around him clearly whilst in the phased world. Omen can use his reload key to alternate between the phased world view and the real world for a normal targeting view. Using normal targeting, Omen can still use his fire keys to move the marker but will keep his standard first-person perspective from his body's location, being able to see everything that is happening in front of him. The smoke can be deployed at any position in range and any altitude. Once deployed, a shadow orb will travel from Omen's location to the target location. Enemies cannot see this orb whilst it is traveling. Upon reaching its destination the orb will transform into a smoke. If the center of the smoke is not directly on top of a horizontal surface, the smoke will sink vertically until this condition is met. Vision within the smoke is clear. The smoke will play audio and visual cues shortly before it is about to expire. Once it expires, the smoke will instantly dissipate. Dark Cover Equip.png|Equip in phased world Dark Cover Equip real world.png|Equip in real world Dark Cover Cast.png|Cast Dark Cover Activation.png|ActivationIncendiary is a ability that Brimstone has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will launch a grenade that bounces against surfaces, reducing its arc and velocity with each bounce before eventually detonating. The detonation will only occur on contact with horizontal terrain. The grenade will bounce a maximum of two times off of horizontal terrain before detonating on next contact with it. Upon detonation, the grenade will create a damaging zone that quickly spreads out from the point of detonation in a circular area of effect. will begin to take damage as soon as the zone spreads to an area they are standing on. The zone will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but agents will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they were at the center of the zone on detonation compared to a player who was closer to the edge of the zone on detonation. Once the zone reaches its maximum radius, it will continue damaging any player it touches until it expires, at which point the whole zone will instantly dissipate. Incendiary Equip.png|Equip Incendiary Cast.png|Cast Incendiary Activation.png|ActivationStim Beacon is an ability that instantly tosses forward on activation. Once it lands on the ground, the beacon will create a field that grants all players within it , as well as granting additional increased equip speed and movement speed. The buff remains active on the agent as long as they remain within the field or for a short amount of time after either leaving the field or after the beacon expires. The beacon cannot be destroyed and enemy agents will not gain the buff if they enter the beacon's field, nor can they see the field's radius. Stim Beacon Cast.png|Cast Stim Beacon Activation.png|ActivationSky Smoke is a ability that Brimstone has to equip before casting. Upon doing so, a tactical display of the map he is on will appear. This display is centered on Brimstone's location and will adjust as he moves but it has a maximum radius and will not display the entire map. Once the display is set up, Brimstone can select a location to place a circular marker, showing where a smoke will land and how much of an area it will cover at most. Once Brimstone confirms the locations of his smokes, they will begin to deploy from the sky for a short amount of time. During this time, all players will see a visual indicator of the position the smoke will land in and hear an audio cue. Upon landing, a smoke will rapidly expand. Vision within the smoke is obscured. The smoke will play audio and visual cues shortly before it is about to expire. Once it expires, the smoke will instantly dissipate. Sky Smoke Equip.png|Equip Sky Smoke Cast.png|Cast Sky Smoke Activation.png|ActivationOrbital Strike is a ability that Brimstone has to equip before casting. Upon doing so, a tactical display of the map he is on will appear. This display is centered on Brimstone's location and will adjust as he moves but it has a maximum radius and will not display the entire map. Once the display is set up, Brimstone can select a location instantly cast the ability at the selected location. Upon activation, the laser will begin to charge up for a brief duration. During this time, all players will see a visual indicator of the position the laser will cover and they will hear an audio cue of the laser winding up. If they are within the targeted area both during the windup and whilst the laser is active, warning VFX will also appear on their screen. Once charged up, the laser will instantly cover the entire targeted area and begin dealing damage to anyone within it. It also acts as a , blocking line of sight and preventing abilities that require line of sight from affecting targets through the laser. Towards the end of its duration the laser will fade away, receding from its maximum radius towards the center but continuing to deal damage in any area that it is still covering. The laser will always deal damage to agents at the same rate, but they will take more total damage over the ability's full duration if they are at its center compared to an agent who is closer to the edge of the area as it recedes. Orbital Strike Equip.png|Equip Orbital Strike Cast.png|Cast Orbital Strike Windup.png|Windup Orbital Strike Activation.png|ActivationTrapwire is primarily an ability that has to equip before casting. Once equipped, his crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a trapwire. This will turn blue if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in and will turn red for unviable positions. A viable position must have two pieces of terrain opposite each other (this can be wall-to-wall or floor-to-roof). The distance between these locations cannot exceed a maximum distance and Cypher must be within a certain distance of the target location to cast the ability. Upon casting, the wire will travel to the location and briefly deploy, creating a trap that spans the distance between two attachment points, then turns invisible. Deployed wires can be picked up to regain the charge with no cooldown. Once deployed, the wire remains indefinitely. Enemies who approach it can detect its presence just before they get close enough to trigger it. It will appear red and the enemy will hear it humming. Enemies can deal damage to either of the attachment points and destroy them to deactivate the wire, though Cypher and his team will be alerted if the wire is destroyed. If the wire is triggered instead by enemies or some utility getting into closer proximity, it reveals itself and starts to wind up, instantly and the victim and permanently ing them with a real-time silhouette for the duration. The enemy team can destroy the wire to end these effects. If neither of the wire's attachment points are destroyed when it completes its windup, it will afflict a effect onto its target and deal a small amount of damage to them. If the wire's attachment points still remain shortly after this, the wire will then re-arm itself. If Cypher is killed or , any placed wires will deactivate and reveal the positions of their attachment points. Trapwire Equip.png|Equip Trapwire Cast.png|Cast Trapwire Activation.png|Activation Trapwire Triggered.png|Triggered Trapwire Recall.png|RecallCyber Cage is a ability that instantly tosses forward on activation. This places a cyber cage as soon as it touches the ground, turning invisible and remaining indefinitely. During the buy phase deployed cages can be picked up to regain the charge, but once the round has started they cannot be recalled. When Cypher activates a placed cage, a white, hollow, open-ended cylinder will form at its location. If an enemy passes through the cylinder's edges, it will play an audio cue. Towards the end of its duration, the edges will begin to fall from the top towards the ground. The cylinder's open ends are aligned vertically and the cylinder's center is positioned at the location where the cage was activated. This means the cylinder's edges deploy both above and below ground. Whilst this effect won't be seen when deployed on completely solid, horizontal ground, this becomes applicable when the cage is activated near an area where the map's elevation changes and gets lower, be it a gradual slope or a steep vertical drop. Cyber Cage Cast.png|Cast Cyber Cage Placement.png|Placement Cyber Cage Activation.png|ActivationSpycam is an ability that has to equip before casting. Once equipped, his crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a spycam. This will turn blue if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. A viable position must be a wall with enough verticality, though the camera cannot be placed over a certain height above the altitude level Cypher is situated at on cast. Cypher must also be within a certain distance of the target location to cast the ability. Upon casting, the spycam will travel to the location and briefly deploy, turning invisible once this process is complete. The camera can be recalled but will go on a short cooldown before it can be redeployed. Once deployed, Cypher can use the ability to take control of the camera, causing it to reveal itself. His body will remain still in a channeling position while using the camera, leaving himself vulnerable to enemy gunfire and utility. The camera provides vision of anything in front of it and can be rotated within the range of a hemisphere. If an enemy is sighted through the spycam, they will be alerted with looping audio for the duration that they are actively being watched by Cypher from within the Spycam. Whenever re-used, the camera will always be looking the direction Cypher was previously looking in when he unequipped the ability. If Cypher's body takes damage while he is in control of Spycam, the ability will be unequipped. While using Spycam, Cypher can aim at enemy and fire to shoot marking darts at them. If a dart hits an enemy it will embed itself into them, periodically ing their location with still image sihouettes. To end this effect, the victim must channel for a few seconds to remove the dart. Enemies can deal damage to the camera and destroy it, though Cypher and his team will be alerted if the camera is destroyed. If Cypher is killed or , the spycam will deactivate and reveal its position.

Upon doing so, Cypher will throw his hat towards the body. Once the hat reaches the corpse it will windup before ing the locations of all living enemies remaining on the map. After a short duration, the ability will reveal the locations of all living enemies a second time. Neural Theft uses still image silhouettes for its reveals. Neural Theft Cast.png|Cast Neural Theft Activation.png|Activation Neural Theft Reveal.png|RevealFault Line is a ability that has to equip before casting. Upon doing so, he will see an area of effect in front of him. Breach can increase the length of this area by charging the ability for a brief duration. The longer he charges for, the larger the ability's length becomes. Upon activation the quake will instantly appear, winding up briefly before exploding to any player within its area. The area of effect spawns several meters in front of Breach. Fault Line Equip.png|Equip Fault Line Cast.png|Cast Fault Line Activation.png|ActivationFlashpoint is a ability that has to equip before casting. To cast, Breach must take aim at a wall using a custom crosshair. This crosshair will turn yellow if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red if it is placed on a position where the charge cannot pass through to the other side. On activation, Breach will fire a charge that travels from his location to the targeted position on the wall, then through the section of wall until it reaches the other side. Once the charge reaches the other side of the wall it will briefly windup before detonating. Any agent or object in line of sight of the detonation will then be . Flashpoint Equip.png|Equip Flashpoint Cast.png|Cast Flashpoint Windup.png|Windup Flashpoint Activation.png|ActivationAftershock is a ability that has to equip before casting. To cast, Breach must take aim at a wall using a custom crosshair. This crosshair will turn yellow if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red if it is placed on a position where the charge cannot pass through to the other side. On activation, Breach will fire a charge that travels from his location to the targeted position on the wall, then through the section of wall until it reaches the other side. Once the charge reaches the other side of the wall it will begin to windup, creating a cylindrical area of effect in front of the wall. Any player within this area will have warning VFX appear on their screen. After completing its windup the charge will detonate, firing multiple bursts in the area that deal damage to anything they hit. Aftershock has no damage falloff.

Upon casting, she will deploy a Boom Bot that, after a brief delay, begins to move forward along horizontal terrain. The bot will bounce off of any walls it comes into contact with. While active, the bots scans for any enemy within a large frontal cone. Should it detect an enemy it will give off a loud warning audio cue and move directly towards the target at increased speed. If the enemy gets out of detection range whilst the bot is chasing them, the bot will go back to traveling in a straight line.

Anything within the inner radius will take full damage. Once in the outer radius, the amount of damage begins to fall off to a minimum at the very edge.

Always ambitious in her work, Killjoy has shamelessly admitted that she has a history of exploiting tech-related missions in order to "weasel more money" out of the Protocol's quarterly budget. While she describes herself as "cool as a cucumber," Killjoy grows frustration whenever she sees her teammates not participating alongside her requests such as testing new tech or reading the data reports she has written. Nevertheless, she is fully confident in her own genius, as seen when she tells her teammates (particularly the tech users) to entrust their gadgets for her to fix, and when she reminds the team to leave the overthinking to her. A glimpse of her sympathetic nature was shown in a voicemail sent to wherein she expressed sadness over the loss of non-military lives following the destruction of the . ===Appearance=== Killjoy is a young German woman with slick dark brown hair and brown eyes.

Once equipped, her crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a bot. This will turn pink if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. Upon casting, the bot will briefly deploy at the location before turning invisible. The bot can be recalled but will go on a short cooldown before it can be redeployed. Once deployed, the bot remains indefinitely. For it to remain active however, Killjoy must remain within a certain distance from the bot. Exceeding this distance will cause the bot to deactivate, becoming visible and not responding to any enemy that pass by it. Reentering the proximity range will reactivate the bot. The bot will also deactivate if Killjoy is killed or . Enemy agents who approach it will be able to see it once they get within close enough proximity. Enemies can deal damage to the bot and destroy it, though Killjoy and her team will be alerted if the bot is destroyed. If an enemy agent gets too close to the bot it will activate in three phases. First it will become alert, revealing itself to enemies. It will then travel from its location towards its target. If it is able to get into closer proximity to the target without being destroyed, it will then jump up and explode, applying to any agents in range.

Upon casting, she throws a grenade forward that sticks as soon as it comes into contact with a horizontal surface. Killjoy can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the grenade at long range whilst Alt Fire throws it at short range. The grenade has no deploy time and can be activated as soon as it hits terrain; the delay between casting and activating is only affected by the time it takes for the grenade to reach its target location. If not activated immediately, the grenade will turn invisible instead and remain at its landing spot indefinitely. During the buy phase deployed grenades can be picked up to regain the charge, but once the round has started they cannot be recalled. Enemy who approach deployed grenades will be able to see them once they get within close enough proximity, also being able to hear it humming. Enemies can deal damage to the grenade and destroy it. Upon being activated the grenade will windup before deploying a damaging swarm of nanobots in a cylindrical area of effect that pierces through terrain. The cylinder's ends are aligned vertically and the cylinder's center is positioned at the location where the grenade was activated. This means the nanobots deploy both above and below ground. Whilst this effect won't be seen when deployed on completely solid, horizontal ground, this becomes applicable when the grenade is activated near an area where the map's elevation changes and gets lower, be it a gradual slope or a steep vertical drop. If Killjoy is killed during the round, any placed grenades will deactivate and reveal their positions.

His research led him to discovering new information relating to both and the alternate dimension that he could access and enter with his powers. Finding a part of the ship with older dimensional fabric, Yoru suddenly fell through into a space that felt as if he was traveling from "now to then". He pushed forward as far as he could and heard a woman's voice calling out to him, one he thought he recognized, but before he could answer back, the rift closed.

Five for me, none for anyone else.|Yoru (Match Start)}} Yoru is undeniably arrogant, and is known to be easily annoyed and irritated by people, including his own teammates. He operates mostly as a lone wolf, preferring to take down entire enemy teams on his own and has initially shown to cooperate with his team only out of reluctance, but over time he would go on to be a team player. Being the powerful rift walker that he is, Yoru thinks quite highly of himself and his abilities, always looking down on his enemies and referring to them as "minnows" - nothing more than small fish. Such thoughts have also been seen in action, being able to put down up to twenty enemies at once all on his own. Though some of these actions are seen as heroic by passers-by when used to bring order to the streets, Yoru himself dislikes being considered a savior or a hero for what he does. While he is irritable, he is not hotheaded nor is he impatient. In fact, his powers compel him to think strategically as he moves behind enemy lines unseen, and he takes his time with moving into position so as to ensure that he takes down his opponents perfectly. This was seen in "," wherein he fended off Omega agents in with more awareness as opposed to blind rush towards the enemy. ===Appearance=== Yoru has spiked hair with two shades of blue, one light and the other being much darker. He sports a black ear piercing on the lobe of either ear, and he has a slit on his left eyebrow. The most notable part of his uniform is his unique blue jacket that has two spikes on both shoulders, an orange insignia depicting a skull imprinted on the shoulders, and his logo that bears resemblance to a wolf embedded on the back. He also wears black pants and a pair of black shoes. When Yoru activates his ultimate ability, he dons a samurai mask that bears an illustration of a mouth with two fangs. ==Abilities== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate==='''''' is an in '''' and the ___th to be released. ==Profile== ===Biography=== Biography = ''Core bio goes here |-| Timeline of events = ====AGENT NAME: Early Life==== ====: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its ___th agent. ===Personality=== ""| (Match Start)}} ===Appearance=== == Abilities == ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Fakeout is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon activation, he deploys an echo that transforms into a mirror image of himself and runs directly forward, creating audible footsteps as it moves. Yoru can use Primary and Alt Fire to control how the ability is set up. Using Primary Fire instantly deploys and activates the echo, whilst using Alt Fire places a stationary and inactive but visible echo that remains in place indefinitely. Yoru can activate a placed echo at any time to make it transform into a mirror image and run forward. When activated, the image runs in a straight line, expiring after a set amount of time. If it collides with vertical terrain, it will try to continue running forward if it hits at an angle but at more perpendicular angles the image will stop in place until it expires, making no sound.

Upon casting he deploys a rift tether. Enemies can deal damage to the tether and destroy it, though Yoru and his team will be alerted if the tether is destroyed. Yoru can use Primary and Alt Fire to control how the ability is set up. Primary Fire causes the tether to instantly travel forward a long the ground for as long as it lasts. If it hits vertical terrain at an angle to its travel direction (i.e. not perpendicular to the terrain) it will continue to move against the terrain until it can travel directly forward at full speed once more without interruption from terrain. Whilst in contact with terrain however, the tether begins to slow down and because of this may come to a complete stop before it can completely move past that section of terrain and continue on its path. The amount of friction between the tether and terrain depends on the angle of the tether's travel direction, with angles closer to being perpendicular to the terrain experiencing more friction. Alt Fire places a stationary tether instead. Whilst active, the tether is invisible to enemy beyond a short distance. They will only be able to see and hear the tether if they are in close enough proximity. Yoru can either '''recast '''the ability to teleport to the tether's location, giving off an audio cue upon arrival at this spot, or '''use '''the ability to trigger a fake teleport, which plays the same audio cues as a regular teleport without actually teleporting Yoru to the tether. A fake teleport will leave a decal on the floor instead visible to all agents for a set duration.

Whilst in Dimensional Drift, Yoru can still use his other abilities to affect enemies. Enemy agents will receive an outline on their screens when Yoru's position is in line-of-sight of their agent. The effect of this outline gradually changes depending on what direction the enemy is facing; if they are in line-of-sight of Yoru's position but are facing directly away from it, they will receive a minimal blue outline, but as the enemy rotates to face towards Yoru's position, the effects of the outline will become larger and include darker black wisps. The effects of the outline are only affected by the direction the enemy agent is facing in; the direction Yoru is facing in does not affect the strength of the enemy's outline. If Yoru gets into close enough proximity of an enemy, they will also be able to hear his footsteps, but are still unable to physically see him. After the duration of the ability expires, or upon reactivation, Yoru emerges back into the physical realm, giving off an audio cue upon arrival at his location.

She uses these in her role as an astral guardian, ensuring that any universe-altering events do not have major consequences. Recruited by the as its sixteenth , "Astra", she continues to serve as an astral guardian in between her missions for the VP, though at times her two roles have come together. When the Protocol was keeping track of the fugitive whilst he was on the run from his in Southern Asia, Astra discovered Batra was also in possession of a Guardian artifact, a set of five rings and a bracelet. Further compelled to bring him in, the VP was able to rescue and subsequently recruit Batra as agent "Harbor". With access to the bracelet, Astra was able to deduce from engravings left on it that it could function as a key to a lost Guardian city that she had never been able to find in her time as a Guardian. To her surprise however, Harbor revealed he had found it before; the "City of Flowers" was located in the Western Ghats of India, but Harbor had arrived there only to find it decimated and sabotaged. Still hoping to salvage something from this situation, Astra's attention turned to and the possibility for a counterpart of the city to also exist there. Further research revealed that it did indeed exist, but the Protocol wasn't the only group interested in it - so were their Omega counterparts, the , and with their motives unknown and 's city in ruins, the possibility of Legion powering up their own city posed a catastrophic threat to millions of Î±-Indians. Together with Harbor and , Astra crossed over to Omega to make the long journey from to Southern India, all the while being pursued by . When they eventually arrived, the found Legion had gotten there first and was preparing to power up the city. Astra could only get a brief look around before the team needed to disable the city's ability to be powered up and then retreat from the site. Having been able to prevent the worst for Alpha but unable to access the city under the control of Legion and Omega security, Astra still has much to learn about the Guardians and their history. |-| Timeline of events= ====EFIA DANSO: Early Life==== *Danso comes from Accra, Ghana.[https://twitter.com/cynprel/status/1367949402753568770 Instagram Astra Lore Quiz] *Danso journeys to a million-year-old crater containing a lake. *Danso becomes an "astral guardian". ====ASTRA: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its sixteenth agent. ====The Omega Project==== *Astra takes time off between missions to attend to her astral guardian duties, ensuring that the construction and use of the - teleporter won't have any major consequences. ====First ventures into Omega==== *Astra is assigned to keep track of a convoy that is pursuing . ** She encourages Brimstone to hunt Batra down before the fugitive's former employer, REALM, gets to him first, as she believes Alpha Batra is the key to finding out what the and Batra's are up to. **There is further encouragement from her when she believes Batra is the one who possesses an artifact that the Protocol has been looking into. **Using a link between Batra's artifact and her own gauntlet, the Protocol is able to narrow down Batra's location in order to carry out an extraction.[https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1578037642230648834 Harbor Twitter Teaser] ====Journey into the City of Flowers==== *Astra is involved with analysis of Harbor's bracelet and its links to the City of Flowers. **She has a discussion with Harbor about his bracelet and the City of Flowers, confirming to him that his bracelet is a creation of the .

Check me then, eh?"|Astra (Round Start)}} Astra is an energetic and joyful agent who doesn't hold back what she wants to say. She is fairly straightforward when it comes to expressing herself and friendly banter is definitely her go-to style. She seems to have an affinity for liveliness, and doesn't like it when people and places have no 'color' or 'personality' to them. She has stated that her plans and ideas may sometimes sound irrational, but this is only because she can see what most cannot due to her cosmic powers. ===Appearance=== Astra is of Ghanaian descent and has a dark skin tone. Her hair, which sports a braided mohawk style, is adorned with multiple gold beads that match with more golden jewelry as a nose ring, multiple earrings on her left ear, and a pair of big hoops.

She wears a pair of purple jeans with metallic kneecaps, with shoes of the same color. ==Abilities== ===Passive=== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Nebula/Dissipate is a ability that Astra can instantly activate by targeting a that she has placed on the map. As the shared name suggests, she can use Nebula/Dissipate in two different ways. Nebula is the primary use of the ability using, by default, the E key that many other abilities use. Using Nebula on a Star will create a long-lasting smoke at its location. Dissipate is the secondary use that uses, by default, the F key that is usually used to operate other items such as door switches or capturing . Using Dissipate on a Star will create a short-lasting smoke at its location. The Star used to activate Dissipate will also be recalled and can be redeployed using after a delay. During the buy phase, using Dissipate on a Star will be recalled without a delay, but will not create a short-lasting smoke. Vision within both smokes is clear. Nebula smokes will play audio and visual cues shortly before they are about to expire. For both smokes once they expire, the smokes will rapidly shrink.

On the defending side players can use the rope at the back of A Site to get onto Bridge and into Hall, and on the attacking side players can use the rope in A Lobby to get into Hall. A Site has an impenetrable, indestructible mechanical door leading into A Hall that can be opened and closed using switches on either side. The door is closed at the start of each round. Towards the Attacker side of Hall is an one-way chute (also known as a 'vent') that can be used to go to Mid. Players and other objects can travel through the chute, which contains an automatic horizontal door. This door cannot be opened from underneath at the chute's exit in Mid, preventing certain agents from using abilities to travel up the chute from Mid into A Hall, as well as preventing other objects from being thrown up the chute. A loud audio cue will be heard whenever the door opens to let something travel down the chute. ==Map== ==Cosmetics== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |25Â° N, 71Â° W | |- | |Defuse Denial | |- | |Breeze Schema | |} {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |Easy Breezy | |} ==Lore== Be careful near the ship, that portal does not work as intended.

After promoting himself as someone who could help VALORANT out with their Omega Project, the Protocol's leadership gave Fabron a position as their eighteenth . Becoming "Chamber", he immediately proved himself to be a necessary asset to the VP's goals, providing blueprints necessary to properly construct an - teleporter, as well as helping with its power issues by recommending with abilities that could help. Even with his new partnership with the VALORANT Protocol though, Chamber's necessary goal still remains to be achieved. With some of his fellow agents (including some of Earth's most skilled investigators and devoted defenders) already having their suspicions about his motives, Chamber has to tread more carefully than ever before if he is to reach his final objective - and be prepared for judgement when the truth of his character is revealed as a result. |-| Timeline of events = ====VINCENT FABRON: Early Life==== *Fabron has links to Saint-Ãtienne and an organization called Culverin. *Fabron works for the French military as a PMC marksman. *Fabron works for as a weapons designer. *Fabron is involved with activities surrounding a teleporter left in the Caribbean on a derelict container ship. *Fabron makes contact with his , also making a deal with him. ====Infiltrating Everett-Linde==== *~T-319: Fabron encounters Oran McEneff at the lab, giving him a business card. *T-298: Fabron attempts to access systems at the facility. **He is barred from facility grounds shortly afterwards. *T-183: Fabron is involved in the disappearance of the facility's chief engineer, Thomas Poe. *T-106: Fabron reinstates security clearance for himself at the facility. **He goes on to obtain schematics from the facility. *T-1: Fabron is seen entering a restricted area. *T-0: Fabron destroys the facility's Large Radian Collider along with his , killing all its on-site personnel. ====Post-Everett-Linde==== *Fabron encounters and . **Fabron meets the two agents under unpleasant circumstances, but afterwards is able to promote himself as someone who could help them with their Omega Project. **Despite some reluctance from the senior VALORANT agents, they accept Fabron's help. ====CHAMBER: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its eighteenth agent. ====The Omega Project==== *Chamber provides VALORANT with blueprints for the Alpha-Omega teleporters from Everett-Linde. *Chamber gives a background check on to Brimstone. **Valdez was a prospect for VALORANT due to having radiant abilities that could help with the Omega Project. **Chamber mentions he cannot not reach out to Valdez for recruitment himself due to having a past misunderstanding with her, and requests that Brimstone contact her instead. *Chamber inquires with Brimstone about removing limiters from Neon's surge protector in order for her to produce enough power to activate the teleporter. ====The Blackmailer==== *Chamber is assigned as a member of the Istanbul strike team. **Chamber's role was to provide fire support from a vantage position, helping to protect the rest of the team when they come under attack. ====Continuing the Omega Project==== *Chamber updates Brimstone on progress with reverse engineering a , saying they are close to a prototype.

We should win big and look good doing it."|Chamber (Match Start) }}With a blend of suave nonchalance, professional poise, and smug comedy, Chamber is fully confident with the skill he provides and the value that he offers. He sets high standards for himself and his team, reminding everyone that if they were to secure victories, they might as well go all-out and be the best in what they do. He has shown friendliness with many of the agents in the Protocol, but he is very much aware that he holds many secrets which are better kept hidden. ===Appearance=== Chamber sports a combover hairstyle and wears a pair of glasses with a thick, rectangular frame. He is seen wearing a blue suit vest over a white long-sleeved shirt, along with a geometrical colorful midnight tie. The said vest has three rifle bullets in place of where the buttons are located. Covering his hands are a pair of brown gloves with white straps that exposes his ring and pinkie fingers. He sports a custom watch with gold straps on his left arm, and he wears a cedar pair of pants held by a belt with white straps and a buckle which sports a unique golden outline. He wears a golden chain clipped across his tie as a strap as well. On the left side of his face are several gold nanotech "tattoos", resembling traces found on a printed circuited board. These tattoos also appear on his arms and cover more of his body below his neck. It is these tattoos that form his ; when Chamber wants to equip the rifle, the tattoos leave his body to construct it. Notably, Chamber's entire suit (without his tie) turns into a gold color whenever he is within proximity of a anchor although it is unknown if this is purely a gameplay mechanic given that this is not the case depicted in his agent reveal trailer. ==Abilities== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Account Levels were added at the start of to recognize and reward all players' loyalty and time invested in the game.

Abilities are only audible to enemies after they are cast; nearby enemies cannot hear when you are equipping abilities. Players are prevented from using abilities if they are . Some abilities can affect both enemies and allies. Such abilities that damage allies deal 1/3 damage, while abilities that has debuff effects affect allies fully. Ability usage differs per . *In most Plant/Defuse modes (, and ), most abilities have a cost to obtain and use (through or ult points), though some are given for free. *In and , all basic and signature abilities are refreshed every round. *In , all basic and signature abilities are set on a cooldown, while ultimate abilties use a percentage bar depending on kills and ultimate . *In , and , individual agents' ability usage are disabled. Several abilities cannot be used during Buy Phase in Plant/Defuse modes as they do not achieve anything if they were to be cast at this time, however others can be as they specifically help agents to set up utility or positioning before the Round Phase begins.

When all charges are used to full effect, all deterrents have the potential to deal over 150 damage, which can kill any enemy from full health and full shields. Deterrents also deal damage to enemy objects. Deterrents can be used to clear an area or corner on the map. This can be used as a way to gather ; enemies will likely make noise as they retreat, which will give off sound cues that alert you to their presence and possibly that they've used an ability to allow them to back away. If there are no sound cues or you aren't notified about killing an enemy, this can confirm that the area is clear of enemies for now. However, players need to be wary about if it's possible for an enemy to return to that position after you have used the deterrent and how quickly they can do so. For areas that are hard for enemies to retreat from, players can use deterrents to punish such positioning by dealing significant damage to the enemy or even being able to kill them. Deterrents can deal damage to both enemies and allies, with allies taking 1/3 damage.An empowerment upgrades an agent in some way. This can include increasing an agent's stats or giving them more powerful utility, such as new . Most empowerment tools only buff the agent that casts the ability, though some are able to empower allies.An intel tool is used for gathering information about the enemy. These can alert a player to the presence of a nearby enemy through sound cues and pop-up alerts on their HUD, or they can reveal the exact location of an enemy through showing enemy outlines, being visibly seen by a player controlling the ability, or traveling to their exact location. Even if an ability does not appear to react to or reveal enemies, this still provides information that an enemy is not in that area. However, players still need to be wary about situations where an enemy could still be nearby even if their presence isn't detected by the intel tool, such as hiding behind or within objects.By default, all traverse the map by running, walking, crouching, or jumping towards their desired locations. Some agents however have abilities that allow them to traverse the map in other ways. This can allow them to access parts of the maps and new angles that other agents cannot.A sustain ability is used to let an agent endure increased amounts of damage that could put them at risk of death or cause it by either replenishing their missing health, granting them invulnerability, or reviving them from a state where they have taken lethal damage.A vision blocker ability is used to block line of sight on an area of the map. This allows allies to carry out actions behind or inside the blocking object without giving visual info to the enemy on the other side, such as moving between positions. Players should be wary that most vision blockers are not solid however and allow gunfire to pass through, so if an enemy hears anything happening they may start to fire through the blocker in the hopes that they will tag or even kill their opponents whilst they are behind or within it. For most vision blockers that allow agents to pass through, their vision will gradually decrease until it is completely covered in a colored, opaque screen as they enter at the edge of a blocker, with the reverse happening as they exit an edge.'''''' is the seventh to be released in ''''. ==Features== Fracture's unique design splits up the map into four neutral quadrants; four central areas between the quadrants that contain the sites and Attacker spawns, and a central zone where Defenders spawn. On Round Start, Defenders can access the sites, which are on opposite sides of the map. Attackers all spawn in one area, but can reach the other side by using the cross-map ziplines that take them underneath Defender Spawn. During the Buy Phase, Defenders are unable to hear Attackers using the ziplines. Each quadrant contains one orb, meaning Fracture has a total of four orbs as opposed to the usual total of two orbs that are present on most other . A Hall contains an automatic door that works similarly to the exit room doors for 's teleporters, as it will instantly open once a player gets close enough, making a loud audio cue as it does, and will also open for any objects thrown towards it. This door on Fracture however will also open for entities on both sides of the door. ===Ziplines=== Fracture features two parallel one-way ziplines that bisect the map. These ziplines do not act like ziplines found on other maps due to them crossing over an out-of-bounds region, and so they have special rules to their interactions: *Upon attaching, the player will automatically move across the zipline at full speed *Whilst attached, players cannot: **Change directions **Use abilities **Detach **Stop (''although you can still slow yourself down holding Shift'') *If the spike carrier drops the spike or gets killed whilst using the ziplines, the spike will respawn on the closer side of the zipline. ==Map== ==Cosmetics== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |Kingdoms Divided | |- | |Operation: Fracture | |- | |Mind the Drop | |- | |Not A Peep |''Miscellaenous |} {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |Deep Divisions | |} ==Lore== Many people died here.

Once equipped, his crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a trap. This will turn blue if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. Upon casting, the trap will briefly deploy at the location where it will remain indefinitely and stay visible to all . For it to remain active however, Chamber must remain within a certain distance from the trap. Exceeding this distance will cause the trap to deactivate and not respond to any enemy agents that pass by it. Reentering the proximity range will reactivate the trap. The trap will also deactivate if Chamber is killed or . The trap can be recalled but will go on a short cooldown before it can be redeployed. Enemies can deal damage to the trap and destroy it, though Chamber and his team will be alerted if the trap is destroyed. If an enemy agent gets too close to the trap it will briefly take aim and fire at the target. If Trademark loses sight of its target whilst taking aim, the wind up will cancel but the trap will not deactivate. If the target remains in vision for the full duration the trap will lock on and fire regardless of distance between the trap and the agent's current position. Once an agent is hit, a temporary slowing field will be created on the ground under the target's current position. If the target is airborne when they are tagged, the slow field will usually form on the ground directly underneath their position. In this case, the agent may not be affected by the slow if they are far enough above the field.

Big mistake"|Neon (Ace)}}With her electrifying speed allowing her to charge into the heat of the battle, Neon is not one who can promise her allies that she'll stay out of harm's way. While she is confident in her abilities and the value it can bring during gunfights, she can sometimes struggle to control her electric powers and thus makes it a point to keep them in check at all times. Neon has strong and close ties with her family; as soon as she arrived at the headquarters, she made sure to call her parents to update them on the news.[https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1478531747696582658 @PlayVALORANT Neon Teaser: Neon calling her parents] According to , Neon has a strong sense of service which she gets from her family. She also cares a lot for her teammates during missions, reminding them to take care and to stay alive because as she states, she hates making new friends. === Appearance === Neon is a young Filipina woman with olive skin and a short stature. She sports an athletic attire with black and blue running leggings along with a pair of sneakers. She also wears a dark-blue cropped vest that appears to act as electrical conduits for her powers. Her arms and face have light blue patterns that can illuminate with her radiant abilities. She has shoulder-length shaggy hair, colored mainly electric blue with streaks of yellow throughout and wears it in a half-up pigtails hairstyle. She also wears a belt and accessorizes with a golden bracelet on each arm. When using her radiant powers to channel electricity through her body, the patterns on her arms, face, as well as her eyes glow light blue along with her hair, which stands up due to the electricity. ==Abilities== ===Passive=== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Fast Lane is a ability that instantly casts on activation. She throws a missile forward that travels in a straight line, stopping if it comes into contact with any terrain. For a distance in front of Neon equal to the horizontal distance traveled by the missile, two walls of static electricity will form in a straight line either side of the missile's path. The walls will also form a short distance behind Neon, and then rapidly rise starting from Neon's location. These walls can pierce through terrain but will only do so if the casting missile was able to travel over or under the terrain without colliding with it. Once it expires, the wall will rapidly disappear, starting from the end where Neon first cast Fast Lane.

The projectile will impact with up to two surfaces, bouncing off of the first one. If the projectile has not impacted two surfaces after a certain amount of time, it will disappear. At each point of impact, a ive zone will form on the first piece of horizontal terrain directly underneath that point, also going through terrain. The stun will activate after a brief delay and affect all in its radius. Relay Bolt Cast.png|Cast Relay Bolt Activation.png|ActivationHigh Gear is a ability that can instantly activate to increase her movement speed and jump distance. Neon can deactivate and reactivate High Gear's speed boost any time she wants, though she must always have enough '''Energy''' to activate the ability, which will be consumed as long as it is active. Neon can use her other during High Gear, but cannot equip any . High Gear will last as long as Neon keeps it active and its effects will end once her Energy pool has been depleted. Whilst sprinting, Neon gives off distinct run SFX and will leave fluorescent footprints on the surfaces she runs over that last for a short duration. During High Gear, Neon can use Alt Fire to consume a charge and trigger a slide. The slide can only be activated as long as Neon is moving forwards or sideways. Activating the slide will immediately deactivate High Gear, and Neon will reduce herself to crouch height during the slide.Overdrive is an ability that can instantly use. Upon activation, she refills her '''Energy''' (if not already full) and equips herself with a damaging lightning beam. She will simultaneously activate whenever Overdrive is equipped. During Overdrive, Neon can use all her and equip other weapons, being able to reequip the lightning beam, but her Energy will continuously drain until it is depleted no matter what tools Neon currently has equipped. Overdrive will last as long as Neon is consuming Energy and its effects will end once the pool has been depleted. Overdrive's lightning beam fires in a straight line with infinite range, penetrating through enemy but not through terrain. It is perfectly accurate both standing still and in most cases whilst moving, with the exception of being airborne. The beam has a ammo count that acts as its "magazine", and this will (after a brief delay) automatically and rapidly reload one by one if Neon is not firing or when Neon runs out of ammo. Neon is able to fire the beam whilst it is in the process of replenishing without waiting for the "magazine" to completely fill up, interrupting the reload. The "reserve" for this lightning beam is infinite. Neon can Alt Fire with the lightning beam equipped to consume a charge from High Gear and trigger its slide, so long as there is a charge available. The slide cannot be activated whilst Neon is already firing her beam, but the beam can be fired immediately after activating the slide.A decoy ability attempts to draw an enemy's attention towards the ability, allowing the user to catch them out whilst they are distracted. Some decoy abilities have the ability to "fake out" their opponents, giving them a 50/50 decision of whether the ability has been properly used in a way that poses a threat to them or whether it's just a harmless fake. Even without dedicated mechanics for faking, some abilities can also utilize their sound effects to act as a fake by casting them in place or canceling them during their channel. This will cause enemies to consider you at a different position or elevation on the map instead of taking a fight at a standard angle. can also act as a fake by causing enemies to turn from it before activating the flash, potentially allowing a quicker response from allies to take out the enemy.'''Fade''' is an in '''' and the fifth to be released. ==Profile== ===Biography=== Biography = A from TÃ¼rkiye, Hazal Eyletmez searches for a person of importance to her after he was 'taken from her'. Using her ability to see nightmare-visions, her interpretations initially led her to suspect that he had been kidnapped by a secret organization she found to be the . Eyletmez decided to contact the Protocol under an anonymous mark, threatening to expose the organization if she found out they were responsible for the kidnapping. When they appeared to only have interest in tracking her down rather than take her seriously, she then contacted each agent personally with a dossier about them to show how much she knew about VALORANT's people and what she could expose to the public if they had no interest in proving their innocence. VALORANT however still refused to give in and soon sent a strike team to Istanbul to apprehend her. Eyletmez attempted to use her Radiant powers to distract them and flee undetected but was spotted just as she was making her escape, allowing the Anti-Yield robot to jump on her position and take her down with a ing pulse. Subsequently detained and taken to a VP base, Eyletmez was interrogated there by senior agents. However, it was because of these direct, face-to-face meetings that a critical piece of information came to light - VALORANT had no idea who she was trying to track down and knew nothing of any kidnapping. Whoever was responsible for the man's disappearance, it wasn't the VALORANT Protocol. It was after this revelation that Eyletmez also came to learn about the existence of other worlds and it was suggested to her that maybe her unknown group came from one of these worlds instead. VALORANT themselves were already preparing to travel to one, having had to put that project on hold in order to deal with Eyletmez. Their search had also exposed how reliant the Protocol was on specific agents for information, and they were looking to recruit more as a result. With there being no more reason for the two to be enemies, VALORANT's senior agents decided to ask if she would join the organization and help them gather information during their trip to . Choosing to put this misunderstanding behind her, Eyletmez accepted their offer to become their twentieth agent, "Fade". She now carries the banner of the VALORANT Protocol - but only as long as it brings her closer to the person she seeks. |-| Timeline of events = ====HAZAL EYLETMEZ: Early life==== *Eyletmez works for as a freelancer. *A person of importance in Eyletmez's life goes missing. **From her interpretations of nightmare-visions, she ends up suspecting that the is responsible for this.[https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/from-the-archives-the-sting-audio-logs-valorant/?linkId=100000126772014 From the Archives: The Sting Audio Logs] ====Blackmailing the VALORANT Protocol==== *Eyletmez contacts with threats of exposing the VALORANT Protocol if they did not prove their innocence regarding the disappearance of her missing person. *In response to VALORANT attempting to track her down, Eyletmez sends to each agent, once again threatening to publicly expose the Protocol if they could not prove their innocence. *Eyletmez attempts to flee from a VALORANT strike team sent to Istanbul. **She uses her powers to stall the Ground squad as she attempts to flee the scene but is suppressed and taken down by . **She is then taken into VALORANTâs custody for interrogation. *Eyletmez is interrogated by and . **Eyletmez is reported to be affecting her surroundings using her Radiant powers during her interrogations, assumed to be attempts at intimidating her captors, which only ends up affecting other agents of the Protocol who were not even aware of her presence on site. ** In one interrogation meeting with Cypher, Eyletmez reveals much of the information she has learnt about the VALORANT Protocol. When they inquire about her missing person, Fade doesn't see the point in bothering to explain the situation to the group she believes knows exactly what they had done to him. However, when Cypher denies VALORANT having any involvement, Fade asks who would be responsible if not them, at which point Cypher reveals the existence of other worlds to her. ====FADE: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its twentieth agent. ** Fade is recruited to help VALORANT scout . ** Fade is willing to help as long as it brings her closer to her missing person, but assures them of retaliation should they stray from their word to her. ====The Omega Project==== *Fade is the first VALORANT agent to use the Protocol's Alpha-Omega teleporter. **She arrives in a city and uses her powers to peer into the minds of its citizens. She finds out many of them are fearful and on edge, and locates a new place of interest for the VP to investigate due to the secrets it supposedly holds. ====First ventures into Omega==== * Fade reports her investigation into , a new advisor to the , to Brimstone. **Alpha Batra is discovered to be a REALM operative, so Fade decides to put Brimstone in touch with the organization. * Fade is contacted by an old colleague of hers, Captain Greaves of REALM, about her inquiry into Alpha Varun Batra. **He acknowledges how long it's been since he and Fade have talked, but will only inform her that Batra is now a fugitive after he stole a priceless artifact, and warns her not to inquire further. ***He contacts her once more when he discovers Batra has been communicating with an unknown entity, suspecting it's her, and warns her once again to stay out of REALM affairs. *Fade reports Batra (now recruited as twenty-first agent "Harbor") and the Protocol are in the clear after they successfully extracted him out of India. ====Journey into the City of Flowers==== *Fade has a Nightmare-vision of Alpha falling apart, its people all gripped by fear, and sees the end of their time. **Soon after, she is reported to be not sleeping well, up and wandering at all hours, and appearing to be always troubled. ====Project Landfall==== *Fade has sessions with to try and help him restore some of his past memories. ====Scions of Hourglass==== *Fade has a Nightmare-vision about , sensing that they are in danger and anticipating a connection to events occurring in Edinburgh with Omen. *Fade is assigned to the Jan Mayen mission's Team 2. **She searches the base for her missing person in the hope that he had been confined there but there is no sign of him. *Fade is assigned to a strike team defending from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha. ===Personality=== It doesn't matter where they hide, I'll find them. I '''always''' find them.|Fade (Match Start)}}Fade's initially perceived harshness is the headliner of her personality, but she has a sense of humor, when she says something that usually is quite deadpan it's often complimented with a quick-witted joke. Working with the operation can feel like a chore to her, wanting things over and done with - often coming across as reluctant even when revived. She seems to harness a little bit of pride for her Radiant abilities and the major advantages they give her (and her team) in battle, and notes the more 'intimidating' agents aren't all what they seem, such as and . She's not shy to admit when she's impressed by any of the agents - actively encouraging when they do well, so she's trying to make sure team synergy is high, and could be argued she actually wants to warm up to the agents, talking about what they can do combined. She would rather not be enemies with who she'll be working with for as long as she gets closer to finding 'him'. Fade seems to pity her mirrored self, saying she's 'seen too much', alluding to the fact that Fade might hate her powers, seeing everyone's raw trauma may help in the battlefield, but seems to bother her mentally, this may be "the price to commune with Nightmare" - she even says 'anything to keep me awake'. ===Appearance=== Fade is a lighter-skinned slim woman, with her dramatic black rectangular eyeshadow, black lipstick, dark oval marking on her face and neck and hair that transitions from black to white with the right half being short and the left half with longer strands around her face, she is given a highly grungy aesthetic. There are distinct cat-like features embedded in her design, from the heterochromia associated with the Turkish breed of Angora/[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Angora Ankara] 'Van' cat, paw print-like marking on her neck and the paw prints on the sole of her shoes. Even her second ability Seize has been noted to look like a ball of yarn. Along with an outfit composed of a dark blue similar to 's, and black accents, such as her shirt/sleeves - which are ripped, matching the gloves she wears that expose hands adorned with henna. Her blue jacket sports a Nazar or 'Evil Eye' which is a symbol of protection from misfortune in TÃ¼rkiye and nearby countries, with a spiky purple collar and silver lining, her jacket is also marked with shapes in this same color. Her pants are black and dark blue, with stitched detailing on her left thigh. On her waist there is a second Nazar where her two bags are, a black one on her right thigh, and a purple one on her left hip. She has steel, capped black leather/leather-looking boots, with paw prints on the sole. ==Abilities== ===Passive=== ===Basic === ===Signature === ===Ultimate===Prowler is primarily an ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she sends out a cat-like prowler. Clicking fire once sends the prowler forward in a straight line in the direction of her crosshair whilst holding fire allows her to control the direction the prowler moves by moving her crosshair in the same direction. Fade cannot use Hold Fire afterwards if she initially sent out the prowler using Fire. The creature will travel until its duration expires, at which point it will dissipate, or until it detects an enemy or '''Terror Trail''' in its frontal vision cone, at which point it will pursue the agent or trail. Upon detecting something, the prowler will gain increased movement speed, moving even faster if it detects a trail compared to detecting an agent. Fade will no longer be able to manually control the prowler if it begins a pursuit. Moving along a trail will reveal to Fade the exact identity of the enemy agent it's pursuing and the trail will become grayed out, making it unable to be used by a second prowler. Enemies can deal damage to the prowler and destroy it. If the prowler then gets into close enough proximity of an enemy agent, it will wind up for a brief duration before biting them, afflicting them with . If a trail the prowler is pursuing either ends its track or expires before it can reach its target, the prowler will then travel in a straight line once more until it either detects a new target to pursue or expires. If a Terror Trail is at a close enough distance to Fade such that a deployed Prowler would instantly detect and pursue it, that trail will be highlighted whilst Prowler is equipped.Seize is primarily a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she will throw a knot of raw fear that activates as soon as it comes into contact with horizontal terrain. Unlike most thrown projectiles that will naturally arc through the air when thrown until they hit terrain, Seize has a set timer. If the knot is still in the air after this time, it will immediately drop down vertically instead until it hits horizontal terrain. Fade can reactivate the ability to cause this drop to happen on command. Upon contact with the ground, the knot will windup for a brief duration, sending out a wave from its location. The wave afflicts on any enemy it hits, though the decayed health will immediately start to be restored at irregular rates. Once the wave reaches its outer radius, any agents still within range and in line of sight of the knot will then be to it and .

Any enemies seen by the watcher within a set radius will become with a real-time silhouette and with a '''Terror Trail'''. Enemies can deal damage to the watcher and destroy it.Nightfall is primarily an ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting she will send a wave of nightmare energy forward. Any enemy agents hit by the wave will be , afflicted with , and with a '''Terror Trail'''. The decayed health will immediately start to be restored at a constant rate after being applied.

Previously working for to recover such sorts of items from the black market and return them to their rightful owners, Batra was regarded as a kind-hearted man but also a deadly force to deal with in combat. His dedication to the cause through years of service fighting criminals earned him a reputation as a hero and a legend. That all changed with one mission to Mumbai. The artifact REALM had sent his team to retrieve this time would be unlike anything the task force has dealt with before, even for their line of work. When he finally came across the room holding the relic, Batra discovered a pedestal in the shape of a hand, bearing five rings and a bracelet. Upon entering the room by himself, the artifact began to activate, becoming drawn to Batra, detaching from its pedestal, and attaching to his hands instead. Batra could tell it held immense power - and he wasn't the only one. He turned around to find one of his colleagues, Greaves, was holding him at gunpoint, demanding that he hand the artifact over so he could take it himself for a secret, rogue faction that had been operating within REALM. As Batra stood his ground in defiance, Greaves opened fire and the bracelet activated, summoning a wall of water between the two men that blocked the bullets from passing through. When the wall dissipated, Batra had fled and Greaves was left in an empty room. Not wanting Batra to ever get the opportunity to report to the rest of REALM what he had tried to do, Greaves framed Batra for intentionally stealing the relic and trying to kill the captain in the process. Using this fabricated story and his rank in the force, Greaves sent convoys out after Batra with the specific order to kill Batra rather than just capture him, forcing him to go on the run throughout southern Asia. With the powers of the bracelet now attached to him though, Batra was more than capable of keeping himself safe from however many men REALM sent to eliminate him, being able to summon and walls of water to protect himself and sweep his enemies away. After almost two months of being pursued by REALM, a lifeline arrived in the form of the , who appeared to have a peculiar interest in him specifically. Batra agreed to an extraction and was picked up by the organization, allowing him to escape from REALM's manhunt for good. With his recruitment into the VP, Batra became its twenty-first agent, "Harbor". Now, he has a new mission in a very different conflict, as the Protocol seeks answers behind the powers and origins of his bracelet, and what their adversaries from might be using it for. |-| Timeline of events = ====VARUN BATRA: Early Life==== *Batra works for . **He gains a big reputation as a "legend" and "hero" of the task force. **He is part of a smuggling ring bust in Algeria. **He stops from completing a hit in Bengaluru. *Batra studies the lost City of Flowers. **He tracks it down after using a map pulled out of the Gulf of Khambhat, but finds it has been decimated and sabotaged. ====Framed fugitive==== *Batra is part of an operation in Mumbai to retrieve a relic, working alongside Captain Greaves. **When Batra enters the room holding the relic, it is drawn to him and attaches itself to his hands. **Greaves recognizes the artifact is more powerful than anything REALM has come across and holds Batra at gunpoint to try and take it for himself and the rogue REALM faction he is a part of.

I've never seen a more beautiful group of heavily armed soldiers."| (Match Start)}}Generally, Harbor is depicted to be an agent with a cheerful personality, his speeches encouraging confidence among his teammates and filled with endearing mirth. He has shown to be an individual with considerable experience in combat, coming from his extended period of time serving under , wherein he built a reputation of being an exemplary soldier worthy of being deemed as a legend. Outside of being an operative, Harbor has also built a reputation of being the "nicest guy you'll ever meet" - assuming you're on the same side as him. However, when the time comes for Harbor to be assigned on a mission, those who worked alongside him will tell about how he is an "absolute terror out on the field." An accomplished historian and antiquarian, Harbor is never shy to proclaim his knowledge and fascination about the worlds of ancient artifacts, history, and architecture. He seems to enjoy his job of working with historical relics and structures. Assign him anywhere in the world, and he just might be able to share a tidbit of his current location's history. ===Appearance=== Harbor has a dark brown complexion, with matching brown eyes, a full brown beard, and long, dark hair sporting a bun. Visibly having a well-toned body, he has elaborate tattoos on his arms, with the right one having an intricate and repeating triangular pattern, and the left bearing the logo of REALM. Harbor's clothing primarily features a green/teal color. His jacket is on the greener side, with a popped collar that shows a blue floral design underneath. His pants are a lighter blue, with several pockets and belts. Hanging around his neck is a single broken dog tag, with what looks to be a computer chip hanging out of the other end. Harbor's left arm also has his Bracelet latched on around the wrist, forming a golden circular band with a gilded blue orb on the top. While usually dormant and collapsed, the Bracelet expands into its 'activated' form when channeling his powers, with the band rotating around his wrist and the orb spinning in place. The 5 rings that he uses in conjunction with the bracelet are dispersed among his fingers, with two on the left hand and three on the right. == Abilities == ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Cascade is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, he will create a wave of water made up of from several chunks rising from the ground, with its face pointing in the direction it is cast. The wave will then move forward in the direction cast, including passing through terrain. Each chunk can rise or fall independently as it reacts to changes in altitude, but cannot rise above or fall below certain values beyond its current altitude, and will either pass through terrain too high or stay at its current altitude in the air until encountering terrain within its range to react to. At a maximum travel distance, or upon re-activation, the wave will stop moving and remain in place for a short duration. Any agent who come into contact with the wave at any point will be briefly . Cascade Equip.png|Equip Cascade Cast.png|Cast Cascade Activation.png|ActivationCove is a ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, he throws a sphere forward that travels until it comes into contact with a horizontal surface. Harbor can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the sphere at long range whilst Alt Fire throws it at short range. Upon impact, the sphere will wind up briefly before creating a sphere of water encased in a shield. Vision within the sphere is clear. Whilst the shield remains active, it will prevent any gunfire from passing through. Abilities can still pass through the shield. The shield lasts until its maximum duration or until it has taken enough damage from gunfire, at which point it will be heard breaking, leaving behind the vision-blocking sphere for a brief duration, before the sphere then instantly dissipates. Towards the end of the shield's duration, its health will begin to decay for a percentage of its remaining health.

Upon casting, he sends a sphere forward that can pierce through terrain. As it travels, it leaves a path on the ground directly below it. The direction and altitude of the sphere can be controlled by holding fire and moving your crosshair in the direction you want it to go. Once the sphere reaches its maximum distance, or upon alt firing while holding fire, a wall of water will start to rise from Harbor's location, spreading across the length of the path until it reaches its end. Any agent who come into contact with the wave at any point will be briefly . Once the wall's duration expires, the whole wall will slowly fall to ground. High Tide Equip.png|Equip High Tide Cast.png|Cast High Tide Activation.png|ActivationReckoning is primarily an ability that must equip before casting. Upon casting, he creates a large, circular geyser pool at a fixed distance in front of him that slowly moves forward over its duration. The speed at which the pool travels can be increased or decreased if Harbor is moving forwards or backwards, respectively, on cast. Moving directly sideways does not affect the pool's travel speed. Periodically, the pool will search for any enemies within. At each instance, for each detected enemy a golden, ethereal wisp will fall vertically from the sky pointing to their detected location, and a small, circular area of effect will be marked at the position they were detected at. After a brief windup time, a geyser strike will then erupt from these positions, any agents caught within the strikes.

It is ''VALORANT'''s second three-site map. This does not affect the number of ultimate orbs on the map; Lotus's two ultimate orbs are present in A Main and C Mound. Two of the map's features are present at the back of A Site. A rope ascender is available to take players from A Site to A Top. When players go down from A Top to A Drop their fall is silenced, provided they do not run and land too far off the drop. A unique feature to Lotus is its rotating doorways. It has one on A Side standing between A Main and A Tree, and another on C Side standing between C Mound and B Main. The doors can be activated from either side using a toggle button, at which point the door will rotate 180Â° over 10 seconds, giving players a small window where they can pass through to the other side. A destructible wall also stands between A Main and A Link. Whilst intact, it absorbs damage and cannot be penetrated by gunfire. The wall however has 400 HP and can be damaged, with colored indicators on it implying how much health it has left (starts blue, then turns yellow and then red as it takes more damage). It can eventually be destroyed to allow players to pass through a passageway between A Main and A Link for the rest of the round. ==Map== ==Cosmetics== {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | |Astral Conduit | |} <!-- {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align: center;" | |+ |- !class=unsortable|Image !Name !Source |- | | | |} --> ==Lore== : ''See also: in map trailer}} In the Western Ghats of 's India, an ancient, lost city has been uncovered.

Gekko is apprehensive, concerned that Wingman might not be able to make it back to Alpha's dimension, but he stands by the radivore as he approaches Deadlock to ask for the accelerator. Gekko pleads with her to trust Wingman as he isn't anything like the more aggressive radivore that had once attacked her, and she eventually relents. **As Wingman enters the portal with the loving support of Gekko, it starts to become unstable, forcing Gekko and the rest of the agents leave the facility. **The portal is successfully shut down, resulting in a massive sinkhole appearing in the facility car park.

One, two, three!|Gekko (Match start)}} Gekko is a relaxed, supportive and kind person. He encourages his team to work together and compliments them whenever they complete a task or impress him. He cares about the safety of his team, and is receptive towards his teammates' ideas and opinions. He usually repeats whatever his creatures say, sharing his thoughts about their dialogue as well. Gekko's focus is teamwork and contributes a calm, laid-back mood to the game. ===Appearance=== Gekko is a young Hispanic-American man that wears a green, purple and orange vest over a short sleeved black shirt, brown sweatpants, white and gold shoes with blue socks, blue and green-yellowish gloves, and a belt around his waist with a globule that holds Mosh. Gekko has dyed green hair, brown eyes, yellow fingertips on his thumbs and bird shaped earrings. Along his arms are tattoos which appear to be some of the things he holds and sees in Los Angeles, such as a juice box with a straw and a man with spiky hair. Surrounding Gekko are his buddies. Mosh is in his belt as a globule, Wingman is sitting on his arm and Dizzy and Thrash surround him. All of these show that he seems to have a chill personality with a stylish look. == Abilities == ===Passive=== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Mosh Pit is a ability that Gekko has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will throw Mosh forward. Gekko can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws Mosh at long range whilst Alt Fire throws Mosh at short range. As soon as they come into contact with a horizontal surface, Mosh will duplicate themselves to create a large, circular area that quickly spreads out from the point of impact. Anything within the area will begin to take continuous damage as soon as Mosh spreads to come into contact with them. After a short windup, the Mosh pit will then explode, dealing multiple ticks of damage in quick succession. Each explosion has a large inner radius and a small outer radius. Anything within the inner radius will take full damage, with anything in the outer radius taking reduced damage. Mosh Pit Equip.png|Equip Mosh Pit Primary Fire Cast.png|Cast (primary fire) Mosh Pit Alt Fire Cast.png|Cast (alt fire) Mosh Pit Activation.png|ActivationWingman is primarily an ability that Gekko has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will send Wingman forward, who will move forward along horizontal terrain. Wingman will bounce off of any walls he comes into contact with. While active, Wingman scans for any enemy agents within a large frontal cone. Should Wingman detect an enemy, he will give off an audio cue and move directly towards the target. If the enemy gets out of detection range whilst Wingman is chasing them, Wingman will go back to traveling in a straight line. If Wingman is able to get close enough to his target, he will jump up then clap his hands together, releasing a blast in a conical area in front of him that any enemy in the zone. When Gekko is on the attacking team, if he is in possession of the and is currently aiming at a point of a spike site whilst he has Wingman equipped, a purple spike indicator will appear in that position on Gekko's screen. Gekko can then additionally cast Wingman using Alt Fire to make Wingman take the spike to that location and plant it. When Gekko is on the defending team, if he is aiming at a planted spike whilst he has Wingman equipped, arrow indicators will appear above the spike on Gekko's screen. Gekko can then additionally cast Wingman using Alt Fire to make Wingman travel to the spike and defuse it. When using Alt Fire, Wingman will run in a straight line to the targeted location. If Wingman cannot reach the targeted location by traveling in a straight line, he will then look to take the shortest possible path to reach that location. Wingman is able to jump up onto objects or over death drops in order to get to the target location. Wingman has all the same interactions with the spike as agents have with it. When Wingman either reaches his maximum search duration or completes an action by releasing a concussive blast or planting/defusing the spike, he will then expire. Enemies can deal damage to Wingman and force him to expire after taking enough damage. When Wingman expires, he turns into a dormant '''Globule'''. If Wingman was carrying the spike when he expired, the spike will be dropped at Wingman's position. The will not announce that the spike carrier is down.Dizzy is primarily a ability that Gekko has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will send Dizzy forward, who spends a brief duration charging up. Whilst active, Dizzy will then fire a plasma blast at each enemy that is in her line of sight within a certain distance. Dizzy can fire multiple blasts at once. The blasts splash in a small circular area around their target on impact, covering the screens of any enemy agents in range of the splash (including Gekko and his allies should they be in the same range as the enemies) with plasma. The plasma will leave some visibility around the edges of the screen, and after a fixed duration will gradually fade away. Affected agents cannot avoid the blind by all means even when turned away. When Dizzy reaches her maximum duration, she expires. Enemies can deal damage to Dizzy and force her to expire after taking enough damage. When Dizzy expires, she turns into a dormant '''Globule'''.Thrash is primarily an ability that Gekko has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he links with Thrash's mind after a brief deployment duration and steers her forward. Gekko's body will remain still in a channeling position whilst guiding Thrash, leaving him vulnerable to enemy gunfire and utility. Thrash has a limited vision radius, glides along the ground, and is controlled using movement and jump keys. Forward input has no effect as she will automatically move forward, and backwards input will only cause her to stop in place. Gekko can activate Thrash during this time to command her to lunge forward and explode. Gekko's perspective will change to a third-person view of Thrash during the lunge, keeping the same maximum vision radius from the first-person perspective. The explosion any agents in range of the explosion, including allies and Gekko himself. After the explosion, Gekko's perspective will return to his own body but will initially still have Thrash's vision radius cap, though this will immediately start to be restored until the vision radius cap is completely removed within a brief duration. The first time in a round that Thrash either reaches her maximum duration or explodes, she then expires. Enemies can deal damage to Thrash and force her to expire after taking enough damage. Gekko can also press Thrash's ability key again to end his link with Thrash prematurely, causing her to expire in place. When Thrash expires, she turns into a dormant '''Globule'''.Team Deathmatch is a 5v5 game mode where players select their agent before going into game. Team Deathmatch has a 20-second pre-game phase and four main stages. Teams begin the match in their side's spawn room. Whilst inside the spawn room, both during pre-game and during the match, players can access their weapon loadout and modify which weapons they'll receive at each stage. Stage 1 is a sidearm-only stage, but for subsequent stages players will carry both their primary weapon of choice for that stage as well as their sidearm of choice for Stage 1. Team Deathmatches are split into four stages; the first three stages are 75 seconds (1m 15s) each, and Stage 4 is 345 seconds (5m 45s). Each Stage changes the selection of guns players are allowed to take, as well as the weapons that spawn from weapon spawners. When a new stage begins, players will be prompted to switch to their next weapon, and will be forced to equip it after a short duration. Upon being killed, players will respawn 1.5 seconds later in their team's spawn room. Whilst remaining in the spawn room, they will be kept invulnerable for 15 seconds but after this they will start to take damage from staying in the room. Players have immediate access to their basic and signature abilities and spent charges will recharge over time, with recharge rates varying depending on the ability. Players gain access to their ultimate by charging it up with points gained from kills (3 points) or collecting Ultimate Orbs (10 points). Some agents need more points than others to charge their ultimate, however the differences in agents' ult costs for Team Deathmatch are not relative to the differences agents have with their ult costs in standard play. Once a team reaches 100 kills, they will win the match. If the match reaches the end of Stage 4 without either team reaching 100 kills, the team with the most kills will be declared the winner. If both teams are tied on kills instead, the match is declared a draw.'''''' is an in '''' and the fifth to be released. ==Profile== ===Biography=== Biography = At one point during the 's investigations into a Los Angeles-based project called "Landfall", the organization was able to pick up on chatter about a cargo pickup happening in Norway. Viewing this to be something of interest, the Protocol sent to follow the team and track down its destination. Leading him to a specialized facility known as The Vault in the far northern archipelago of Svalbard, Sova arrived to find no activity there, no signs of life, except for a faint beacon activated from within. Entering The Vault, the Russian eventually made his way to a containment room to discover the aftermath of an attack, with all the pickup team dead except for one remaining survivor - a blonde-haired woman with one of her arms completely obliterated. The woman, named Iselin, had been one of three elite hunters from the security force StÃ¥ljeger who had been assigned to escort a Project Landfall scientist to The Vault and oversee the extraction and transport of a very special item; a radivore that had mimicked the form of a bear. Her team had also arrived at The Vault to find it empty and with hardly any power left, and on entering Containment they had discovered the radivore had broken out of its enclosure, right before it then attacked them, killing her fellow StÃ¥ljeger comrades and the Landfall scientist in quick succession. With one nearby chamber still operational, Iselin was able to lure the radivore into it. As she attempted to confine it within though whilst the chamber powered up, the bear forced its head between the closing doors, biting down onto her left arm and holding it in its jaws. From that bite, substances from the radivore's body entered Iselin's own system, causing her to become disoriented and hear an echoing voice, before the sound of a gunshot broke her out of her state of delirium. The scientist, in his final living moment while dying on the ground, had fired a shot at the radivore before collapsing. With the chamber now fully powered up, Iselin activated it to produce a surge of energy that filled the chamber and burst through the gap between the doors, obliterating both the radivore and the arm trapped in its jaws. The ordeal now over, Iselin slowly made her way over the the body of the fallen scientist, picked up a dropped beacon nearby, and activated it moments before finally collapsing. After being rescued by Sova, Iselin was taken back to VALORANT HQ, where she received a new prosthetic replacement for her missing arm, and has since joined the organization as its twenty-third agent, "Deadlock". Though grateful for the Protocol's investment, her recent experience has caused her to be bitter towards 's critters, who themselves are also radivores previously held by Kingdom. To her, they and the rest of Landfall's creations aren't friendly companions but creatures with dangerous potential. Now the second agent associated in some way with Landfall to be recruited into VALORANT, interest in Kingdom's project and what its end goals are is higher than ever for the Protocol, and Deadlock will be there to help them uncover its secrets. |-| Timeline of events = ====ISELIN: Early Life==== *Iselin works as an operative for StÃ¥ljeger's Ursa team. *Iselin is assigned to escort a scientist to The Vault in Svalbard for extraction and transport of a radivore bear being held there to Los Angeles. **The team instead discovers the radivore has broken out of its enclosure, killing everyone it is able to catch besides Iselin. **She is able to lure the radivore into a chamber and activate it, but not before the radivore is able to bite down on her left arm, causing the chamber's energy surge to obliterate both the radivore and Iselin's arm along with it. **The only remaining survivor, Iselin is able to activate a beacon before collapsing. She is eventually discovered by . ====DEADLOCK: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its twenty-third agent. *Deadlock receives a new prosthetic arm with a built-in . ** offers to restore Deadlock's arm instead but Deadlock declines. *Deadlock contacts to update him on her progress while she adjusts to her prosthetic arm. ====Project Landfall==== *Deadlock works on response project to deal with the radivores being developed by Project Landfall. *Deadlock fabricates four crates intended to hold 's crew of radivores and stop them from being able to roam free. **Brimstone rejects her proposal to have Gekko's radivores detained, but Deadlock won't take no for an answer and insists that he reconsiders. *Deadlock provides with Kingdom data that allows him to access the video surveillance systems of a Kingdom facility in Los Angeles. *Deadlock works on a custom-made with . *Deadlock is assigned as a member of the strike team. **Upon reaching the portal room, she is tasked with shutting down the portal, but its controls are locked down and her attempt to cover it with a GravNet fails. ** then has a plan to jump into the portal, also requiring Deadlock's nanowire accelerator. While she still remains distrustful of Wingman at first due to her own traumatic experience with radivores, Gekko's pleas and Wingman's gentle approach finally make her relent. After Wingman enters the portal and causes it to become unstable, Deadlock and the rest of the agents leave the facility. **The portal is successfully shut down, resulting in a massive sinkhole appearing in the facility car park. A Legion strike team then arrives there on a mission for Î±-radianite, who Deadlock and the rest of the Protocol team are able to repel. *Deadlock meets Sage, who once again offers to restore Deadlock's arm, but Deadlock refuses to have her injury undone, in memory of her fallen StÃ¥ljeger comrades. ====Scions of Hourglass==== *Deadlock meets with Omen for the handover of an Hourglass journal he had recovered, as well as . **She tries to talk with Omen about his temporary departure from the Protocol but he refuses to speak about it. *Deadlock does firearms training with Clove. *Deadlock is assigned to the Jan Mayen mission's Team 2. **She reports on the security in place at the Elder Grotto and collects samples. *Deadlock is assigned to a strike team defending from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha. *Deadlock analyzes a specialized containment cell at the Elder Grotto. ===Personality=== "Ready up! First, we put them on their heels, then, we put them in the ground."| (Match Start on attack)}} Deadlock has a no-nonsense personality. She takes the protocol's stance very seriously. Due to the fact that radivores have taken the lives of her fallen comrades, she seems to have a huge resentment towards them, going to extreme measures to even detain them, such as 's creatures. Despite the flashbacks of radivores, she still reluctantly trusted Gekko's to complete the mission in Los Angeles by letting him use her . ===Appearance=== Deadlock sports a noticably muscular, stocky build compared to other female agents. She has thick, white hair that goes to her shoulders. She wears a green shirt with a white jacket, along with rugged trousers and boots, an attire likely fit for the cold climates of Norway. Much of her left arm, which was bitten away from a radivore, has a prosthetic, gray limb in place of it which also serves as her nanowire accelerator. As for gear, Deadlock has a placed on her left thigh, and grenades on her right thigh. == Abilities == ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===GravNet is a ability that Deadlock has to equip before casting. Upon casting she will throw a grenade that detonates on contact with horizontal terrain. Deadlock can use Primary and Alt Fire to control the length of the throw; Primary Fire throws the grenade at long range whilst Alt Fire throws it at short range. After a brief windup the grenade sends out a wave of nets from its location in a circular area of effect field that pierces through terrain. The wave of nets embeds itself onto any agent it hits, forcing them to crouch. The net will also cause victims to be inflicted with increased gravity and decreased mobility. The victims must channel for a brief moment to remove the net, giving off an audio cue. GravNet Equip.png|Equip GravNet Primary Fire Cast.png|Cast (primary fire) GravNet Alt Fire Cast.png|Cast (alt fire) GravNet Activation.png|Activation GravNet Slow.png|Sonic Sensor is primarily an ability that Deadlock has to equip before casting. Once equipped, her crosshair will be replaced with an indicator for placing a sensor. This will turn blue if it is placed on a viable position to be cast in, and will turn red for unviable positions. Upon casting, the sensor will travel to the location and briefly deploy, then it will turn invisible and remain at its position indefinitely. Deployed sensors can be picked up to regain the charge with no cooldown. The sensor detects any enemy noise made by running, jumping, shooting, reloading, dropping objects, and planting/defusing the spike. If the sensor detects any of these sounds made by enemies within its area, it will briefly wind up a visible area of effect in front of it and concuss any agent within that area. Enemies can walk through the sensor without setting it off by walking or crouching. When an enemy enters the target area, the sensor will be revealed to them with a red outline. Enemies can deal damage to the sensor and destroy it, though Deadlock and her team will be alerted if the sensor is destroyed. The sensor will deactivate if Deadlock is killed or . Sonic Sensor Equip.png|Equip Sonic Sensor Cast.png|Cast Sonic Sensor Activation.png|Activation Sonic Sensor Triggered.png|Triggered Sonic Sensor Recall.png|RecallBarrier Mesh is a ability that Deadlock has to equip before casting. Upon casting she will throw a disc that activates on contact with horizontal terrain. The disc will generate one central orb on top of itself and up to four smaller orbs to its side, depending on the terrain. An orb will not be generated if it would not be in contact with any horizontal terrain. After a brief windup, the small orbs connect with the central orb, forming transparent walls that prevent agents from passing through them. The distances of the small orbs to the central orb and the heights of the transparent walls generated are also dependent on the terrain. Abilities and bullets are able to pass through the transparent walls. The orbs each have their own health amount, which will increase after being allowed to fortify a few seconds after forming. The central orb has significantly more health than the other orbs. Enemies can destroy an orb by dealing enough damage to it to deplete its health using weapons or some damaging abilities. Destroying the small orbs will destroy the transparent wall that connects that orb with the central orb, while destroying the central orb will destroy all of the transparent walls and orbs. Towards the end of the disc's duration the health of any remaining orbs will each begin to decay for a percentage of their remaining health. Orbs with less health than others will not expire before them, and all remaining orbs will expire simultaneously. Barrier Mesh Equip.png|Equip Barrier Mesh Cast.png|Cast Barrier Mesh Activation.png|ActivationAnnihilation is a ability that Deadlock can instantly use. Upon activation, she winds up and equips herself with a Nanowire Accelerator. Deadlock can use other abilities and weapons without deactivating Annihilation; she can re-use the ability to reequip the accelerator. Deadlock can fire in a direction to release a long-range cylindrical pulse of nanowires that can ricochet off the first surface it hits. After a brief delay upon firing, Deadlock will launch the nanowire pulse, causing herself to be pushed back a few meters directly in the opposite direction she fired the pulse in. At the end of its path (either by reaching its maximum range or hitting a second surface), the pulse will expand into a large sphere if it has not yet encountered an enemy agent. The first enemy caught in the pulse of nanowires will be wrapped around by nanowires in a cocoon form. The victim will have their vision obscured by the wires and will be , though minimap vision is not obscured. The victim will be dragged by a nanowire from their initial position to where Deadlock fired the nanowire pulse from, following the path of the pulse shot including any ricochets. The victim's teammates must destroy the nanowire cocoon before the victim reaches the end of the nanowire path in order to free them from the nanowires' grasp. The victim will travel for a set duration before reaching the end, regardless of path distance. Upon reaching the end of the nanowire path without being freed, the victim will be released from the cocoon and be afflicted with damage equal to current HP remaining, essentially killing them. If the victim is unable to reach the end of the path due to obstacles, the cocoon's health will rapidly decay and be destroyed after a set duration. The victim will be freed from the cocoon and will not be killed. Annihilation has a limited duration and Deadlock will be forced to permanently unequip the accelerator if she does not fire the nanowire pulse in time.

All barriers currently spawn in multiple segments, each with their own amount of , being reduced on creation and requiring a brief duration to fortify to their maximum HP. Towards the end of their maximum duration, their health will begin to decay for a percentage of their remaining health until expiration. Barriers can either be semi-transparent, only blocking movement while allowing bullets and thrown abilities to pass through, or non-transparent, blocking anything that come into contact with it. If a deployed ability that has locked on to a target (e.g. 's ) is blocked by a barrier, the ability will deal continuous damage to it, eventually destroying it to break through and continue on its path so long as it has still not reached its maximum duration.'''Sunset''' is the tenth to be released in ''''. ==Features== Sunset is one of VALORANT's more traditional maps with two sites and three lanes.

Li had been crossing off targets related to 's Project Landfall when one day the Scions of Hourglass changed focus and gave him a new target: a former assassin of theirs known as "Ghost", who they had just discovered was now the phantom agent of the called . To make matters more convenient, VALORANT themselves had also put themselves in a position where Li had become of interest to them anyway. The organization had attacked a Landfall facility just before Li's last assignment, and they were now investigating the unrelated disappearance of Landfall's leadership, people Li had been assassinating. When a contact from the Protocol reached out to ask for his cooperation, Li saw this as his opportunity to get to Omen. Pretending to defect from the Scions of Hourglass, Li was extracted by the Protocol and recruited as its twenty-fourth agent, "Iso". With Iso and the orders from his superiors being responsible for the disappearances they had been investigating, VALORANT was eager to know as much about the Scions of Hourglass as possible. Iso made sure at first to stick to his mission and relent against their inquiries, constantly claiming that the compartmentalized nature of Hourglass' operations meant he didn't have much intel to give them, all while he was biding his time for the right moment to strike and take out Omen. But the longer Iso stayed among the Protocol agents, the more he started to see the differences between the two organizations. In contrast to Hourglass' ruthless missions and isolated work, VALORANT's agents had a brightness to them both in the field with their pride in their mission and out of the field in the time they spent with one another. Going through the process of becoming a VALORANT agent had just been a means to an end for Iso, but in getting to know the organization more his perspective had now been completely changed. Turning his apparent defection from a deception into reality, Iso fully embraced his allegiance to the Protocol. With Omen having been obsessed over Iso's links to his forgotten past ever since he had arrived, Iso proceeded to inform him about the assassination order. With more intel he was able to provide, he also joined VALORANT's efforts to assist Omen in his pursuit for answers, leading them to a successful mission against the Scions of Hourglass at a base in Jakarta, taking out Iso's old boss in the process. With Omen satisfied for the meantime with what he learned there, Iso now continues as an agent of the VALORANT Protocol with a new purpose, no longer a killer to be controlled, but a force of good. |-| Timeline of events = ====LI ZHAO YU: Early Life==== *Li works for the as an assassin. **He gains notoriety on his missions targeting people connected to research related to 's Project Landfall, earning the nickname the "Dead Lilac". *Li eliminates a group of Landfall personnel shortly after an attack on Kingdom Corporation's Los Angeles facility. **After completing this mission, the Scions of Hourglass give him his next target: , an ex-employee. *Li is contacted by the . **Seeing this as a way to get to Omen directly, he pretends to defect from the Scions of Hourglass and agrees to cooperate with VALORANT in exchange for protection against the SoH.[https://clips.twitch.tv/HonorableSpotlessMouseThunBeast-XkjiERKBHa-dniis EP 8 Act 1 Dev Livestream: Iso's original loyalty to the Scions of Hourglass] ====Iso: VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its twenty-fourth agent. *Iso contacts Brimstone as he settles into the organization. *Iso keeps on being asked about the Scions of Hourglass by , despite Iso claiming to him that he has informed him of everything he knew already. *Iso contacts Brimstone as he reflects on the differences between working for the Scions of Hourglass and VALORANT. *Iso chooses to truly defect from the Scions of Hourglass and proceeds to inform Omen about their assassination order on him. *Iso is assigned as a member of the Jakarta strike team. **He and Cypher first travel to Casablanca and take down a cell there to obtain intel on the location of his former boss, which they learn is at an Hourglass skyscraper base in Jakarta. **In Jakarta, he is tasked with a supportive role while Omen enters the base alone. *Iso informs Brimstone of a new animosity he has observed between Omen and Viper. *Iso offers to run drills with the agents to prepare for continued conflict against the Scions of Hourglass. *Iso informs Omen about the Protocol's mission to the Hourglass Elder Grotto. *Iso is assigned as a member of the strike team. **Upon securing the Elder Grotto, Iso recognizes some of the artifacts being held there from jobs he did. *Iso is assigned to a strike team defending from the VALORANT Legion as part of a set of simultaneous incursions across Alpha. ===Personality=== "One minute, finding a playlist."

Despite this, he can still fight alongside his team, planning strategies to outplay his enemies. ===Appearance=== Iso wears an overall white-colored hoodie, with dark purple colors reaching to his collar, along with some markings at the back, as well as a pair of purple-colored sneakers with red laces, white midsoles and black outsoles. He has black hair, and what appears to be a bandage on his right cheek, and has earbuds in his ears. == Abilities == ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Contingency is a ability that has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will create a wall of energy that rises from the ground, with its front face pointing in the direction it is cast and its edges bent inward. The wall will then move forward in the direction cast, passing through any terrain. The wall can rise or fall as it reacts to changes in altitude, but cannot rise above or fall below certain values beyond its current altitude, and will either pass through terrain too high or stay at its current altitude in the air until encountering terrain within its range to react to. The wall prevents bullets from passing through to the other side. can still be thrown through the wall. The wall will play audio cues shortly before it is about to expire. Once it expires, the wall will rapidly shrink to the ground.

After a brief delay, Iso gains a shield, becoming invulnerable to all sources of damage (excluding the explosion from the ), and enters a flow state for a limited time, gaining increased reload speed. The shield lasts for the remaining duration of Double Tap or until Iso takes a single instance of damage from any bullet or ability. that would otherwise damage Iso will not cause the shield to break. During the flow state, an enemy killed by Iso, or damaged by Iso and killed later, will spawn an energy orb above their location that remains there for a brief moment. Iso can shoot this orb to gain another a purple shield around him or refresh the timer on an existing shield, and refresh the duration of Double Tap. Enemies can shoot the energy orb to destroy it and prevent Iso from gaining its effects. Double Tap Cast.png|Cast Double Tap Activation.png|Activation Double Tap Orb.png|Orb Double Tap Shield.png|ShieldKill Contract is a ability that Iso has to equip before casting. Upon casting, he will hurl a column of energy in front of him. If any enemy agents are detected within the column, both Iso and the closest enemy agent to him within the column will be banished from the battlefield and transported into an interdimensional arena. If any of the agents is carrying the , they will be forced to drop the spike at their current location. A purple marker will be visible on the ground in the normal world at Iso and the enemy's location when they were teleported into the arena. Both agents will spawn on opposite sides of the arena and remain in position for a short duration while the arena is fully constructed. Two walls will also spawn to each of Iso's sides just in front of him, while another Contingency wall will spawn directly in front of his opponent. On spawn, Iso has unobstructed vision of his opponent's Contingency wall and its edges. Iso and his opponent will have their health and shields replenished, bullets reloaded, and be while inside the arena. Additionally, Iso will automatically refresh his duration if it was already active without consuming an additional charge. After the arena has been constructed, Iso and his opponent will then be freed to duel and kill the other in order to end the ability and return to the battlefield. After a brief duration, the Contingency walls in the arena will deactivate. Once someone is killed, the victor will be teleported back to their original position after a brief duration with their original health points restored. If both agents survive after a set duration in the arena, they will both be killed instead. During transport both to and from the arena, Iso and his opponent will have their vision be completely obstructed, which will fade away on arrival.

It has the same gameplay rules as Swiftplay, however, all players in the lobby are AI-controlled bots.The Outlaw is a moderately-priced sniper rifle. As a sniper, it has a scope with a single setting on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. The Outlaw's Primary Fire accuracy on the other hand is very inaccurate. As a double-barreled, break-action rifle, the Outlaw has two different reload options depending on whether the player needs to reload bullets into one or both of its barrels. When reloading one barrel, the player will firstly remove the empty cartridge remaining before quickly reloading the barrel. When reloading both barrels, the player will remove each empty cartridge one after the other before reloading both barrels simultaneously. The duration of reloading one barrel is on par with many other weapon reload times, but the duration of reloading both barrels is one of the longest in the game. The audio cues for these reloads are also distinct from each other, allowing nearby enemies to tell the difference between when an Outlaw user is reloading with one bullet still remaining or not. In comparison to '''''s other sniper rifles, the Outlaw fits between the cheaper and the costlier . As with the other snipers, headshots with the Outlaw will always be rewarded with an instant kill. For body shots however, the Outlaw can kill an enemy with in one shot (something the Marshal doesn't have the damage to do) but cannot do the same for an enemy with full (something the Operator can do).'''''' is an in '''' and the sixth to be released. ==Profile== ===Biography=== Biography = The young Scottish VALORANT agent Clove possesses powers unprecedented among even their fellow s - the power over the essences of life and immortality. Each death instead brings them to a whole new world, a junction between the realms of the living and the dead, one that Clove will journey through on their way to return to life and themselves. But such abilities are unlikely to be a blessing forever, and Clove themselves finds they can never spend too long in the junction beyond life as the longer they spend there, the harder it is to return. |-| Timeline of events = ====Early Life==== *Clove is killed by the . *Clove encounters at a library in Edinburgh and ends up in a fight alongside him. *Clove is handed over to along with a journal Omen had recovered at the library to be taken to the . ====VALORANT agent==== *Recruited as its twenty-fifth agent. *Clove does firearms training with Deadlock. *The door of Clove's room at HQ gets stuck with Clove still inside. ====Scions of Hourglass==== *Clove works with and to investigate the Hourglass journal recovered by Omen. *Clove goes with Cypher to check out some islands they believe are the location of the Hourglass Elder Grotto. *Clove is assigned as a member of the strike team. ===Personality=== "It's fun being a secret agent and all, but I really hope that there's an alternate universe out there where I'm just growing old with a bunch of cats."| (Match Start)}} Clove is fearless as they do not see death as a scary thing, in fact, they see it as beautiful.

They accessorize themselves with jewelry such as a choker, a matching bracelet, a butterfly-esque earring, and nine rings; two of which are each half of a butterfly, one is a heart with horns, one appears to have a neutrois gender symbol attached to a single chain link to represent their nonbinary identity, while the rest are more simple. Their nails are painted black with blue French tips apart from the index and middle nail on each hand, which are black with blue butterfly wings, each nail being half of the butterfly similar to the rings they wear. They also carry a backpack and a fanny pack with straps across both sides of their waist. ==Abilities== ===Basic=== ===Signature=== ===Ultimate===Pick-me-up is primarily an ability that becomes available to activate after an enemy agent dies under certain conditions. To be eligible for the ability activation to become available, Clove must either have been credited with killing them or Clove must have damaged the enemy within a certain amount of time before their death. Once Pick-me-up is enabled to be activated from an enemy's death, Clove may do so within a limited duration to instantly gain increased movement speed, also ing rapidly up to a maximum amount. Butterflies will gather on the corpses of any enemies for the duration of the activation window enabled by their death. Pick-me-up's Overheal will not replenish Clove's nor replenish their HP. The maximum amount gained from Overheal cannot exceed the total maximum of 150 HP for shields, , and Overheal health combined, and any additional healing received during the duration of the buff will remove Overheal health to maintain the maximum of 150 HP.

The map is centered on Clove's location and will adjust as they move but it has a maximum radius and will not display the entire map. Clove can select a location to place a circular marker, showing where a cloud will land and how much of an area it will cover at most. Once Clove confirms the locations of the clouds, they will begin to deploy for a short amount of time. During this time, all players will see a visual indicator of the position the cloud will land in and hear an audio cue. Afterwards, a cloud will rapidly expand from the ground at the indicator. Vision within the cloud is clear. The cloud will play audio and visual cues shortly before it is about to expire. Once it expires, the cloud will instantly dissipate. Clove can continue to use this ability after they die, with a smaller radius on the view of the map centered at their corpse. Clouds cast during this time will have darker colors instead.

Upon casting, Clove will resurrect back up with a brief windup animation with full HP (excluding shields) and become intangible for a short duration, being immune to any incoming damage but unable to use any weapons or other abilities for the duration. While intangible, Clove will have an ethereal appearance mostly made of a transparent body with lavender outlines. Clove can recast to end the intangibility early. After the intangibility expires, Clove will enter a brief animation while they break out of this state before the player regains full control of them, during which time they can be damaged. Once full control is regained, they must score a kill or damaging assist within a set timer to stay alive. If they are unable to do so, Clove will die once the timer expires. Clove cannot cast this ability after the round concludes with the enemy team scoring a point.
